NEW BUSINESS
COLSON WHITEHEAD AUTHOR EVENT
Author Colson Whitehead is coming to the Library on Wednesday, September 14th at 7:00 p.m. for an author event.  His book "The Underground Railroad" is the Oprah's Book Club selection for 2016 and is currently #1 on the New York Times Best Seller List.  The book chronicles a young slave's journey during a desperate bid for freedom in the antebellum south.
Most reviewers are expecting this to be the biggest book of the year and are already anticipating nominations for the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award.  We are expecting a very large crowd and the auditorium cannot accommodate the amount of people expected.
The Library approved the Administration’s recommendation to close Headquarters at 5 p.m. for the Colson Whitehead event on September 14, 2016 (Mulligan/Tai).
ADJOURN
Michael Mulligan made a motion to adjourn the meeting.  Dr. Tai seconded.  All approved with voice vote. Aye: Lynn Beckwith, Dr. Chingling Tai, and Michael Mulligan. The Library Board meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. (Mulligan/Tai).
Respectfully submitted,                                                          Date
