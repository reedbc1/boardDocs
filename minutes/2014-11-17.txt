		DIRECTOR'S REPORT
		Kristen Sorth gave the following report.
		Facilities Master Plan Update
		Ms. Sorth stated that, beginning today Steve Hunter will be updating the Board each month on the construction projects.
		Ms. Sorth gave the following Library Update
		·        The “dashboard” report for November contains a variety of statistical information for the Library. This month the report includes statistics about circulation, visits, programming and the most popular items from the collection.  The dashboard also contains a chart listing the top five zip codes by number of cardholders. Statistics show that Florissant, Black Jack, Ballwin, Oakville and Affton are the top cardholders by zip code. In addition, there is information about our successful Library Card Campaign.  Eric Button will present the Library Board with more detail regarding the campaign later in the meeting. The “dashboard” report was shared with the Board.
		·        Ms. Sorth had mentioned previously that State Aid for public libraries was withheld by Governor Nixon due to budget concerns.  In the last couple of weeks, a portion of State Aid for 2015 was released by the Governor and designated for the state’s smallest libraries.
		·        The Library’s six-week-long Earn-A-Computer program for students ended last Tuesday night with a graduation ceremony where the students received their computers. All 12 students successfully completed the course and there was perfect attendance for all six nights of the class.  The class was led by Chris Romer from St. Louis BWorks and assisted by Dan Gibbons from the Library's Training Department.  Gib Van Cleve attended the graduation ceremony and talked with several enthusiastic parents who provided positive feedback regarding their child's experience in the class.  Ms. Sorth said that we hope to continue the Byte Works partnership with two more classes to start in early 2015. One will be at a north county branch and another at a south county branch. A picture of the graduation program was shared with the Board.
		·        The partnership between the Library and the Mid-East Area Agency on Aging (MEAAA) is going very well.  In the first month, 259 seniors attended programs offered at Daniel Boone, Florissant Valley and Tesson Ferry.  Sessions include topics related to health, nutrition, resources and exercise all geared toward seniors.
		·        Through the Library’s partnership with the St. Louis Astronomical Society and a private donation, telescopes became available for Library patrons at Florissant Valley, Daniel Boone, Tesson Ferry, Lewis and Clark and Headquarters on Monday, November 10th.  All are currently checked out and over 45 people are on a waiting list for the telescopes.  Five other telescopes will be used for Library programs.  An article regarding the program appeared on St. Louis Public Radio’s website.  That article was shared with Board members.
		·        The Library partnered with OASIS to provide Better Choices, Better Health diabetes workshops at nine branches this year.  The workshops were very well attended with 140 participants.  This partnership will be continued next year.
		·        Ms. Sorth had mentioned last month that the theater group at St. Louis Community College at Meramec conducted a book drive to support the Library’s Sweet Reads program.  The book drive collected 700 books for Sweet Reads.
		·        Lewis Rohrbach, President of Picton Press, has donated his personal collection of genealogy materials to the Library. The collection consists of almost 12,000 volumes that needed to be shipped from Switzerland, where Mr. Rohrbach lives for part of each year. The collection arrived on October 31 and was delivered to Florissant Valley. Scott Holl, Manager of the History & Genealogy Department will arrange a date when staff and volunteers can help unpack and shelve the materials. The materials will then be cataloged a few at a time and shelved at Headquarters.  Barbara Brain explained how conversations between Mr. Rohrbach and Joyce Loving, the previous manager of the History & Genealogy department resulted in the collection being donated to the Library.
		·        Late last year, the Library contributed to a Beyond Housing grant application to Citi Foundation. The Library's portion of the grant application involved a plan to support literacy at Normandy Middle and High Schools by providing book discussion kits of culturally appropriate materials. The grant application was successful and enough materials have been ordered to create 30 book discussion kits. Natural Bridge Branch staff will also host a literacy night at the branch next spring where students and their parents will have the opportunity to participate in various activities and apply for Library cards.
		·        The Library’s Winter Reading Club will begin on December 1 and run until February 28, 2015.  Kids, teens and adults may all participate in the club.
		·        Starting in January, the Youth Services Department will begin offering a new series of programs for teens entitled In the Know @ Your Library.  The programs, aimed at assisting teens with navigating the ins and outs of impending adulthood, will be offered at all library locations.  Workshops on resume writing, cooking skills and etiquette will be presented for youth ages 12-18.
		·        St. Louis County Library has been named one of the nation’s Star Libraries in the recent release of the Library Journal Index of Public Library Service. Since 2009, Library Journal, the oldest publication in the library field, has been publishing “America’s Star Libraries,” using four measures to compare public libraries across the nation (circulation, visits, program attendance and public Internet use) all per capita. 2013 was the first year that the St. Louis County Library was recognized; we received three stars.  This year, the Library received four stars. We believe this award recognizes the tremendous service we provide to the St. Louis County community. Two articles regarding the Star Libraries from Library Journal and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch were shared with the Board.
		·        There were additional mentions of the St. Louis County Library in the media.  The St. Louis American included information about the Lewis and Clark groundbreaking and Library Hotline included information about our programming efforts during the unrest in August.  These articles were shared with the Board.
		·        Ms. Sorth had selected a number of photographs to show the Board from several programs and events including:  Comic Con at Tesson Ferry, the Golden Warriors at Jamestown Bluffs, the Lewis and Clark groundbreaking, Julius Hunter’s author visit at Headquarters, Billyo 0’Donnell and the St. Louis Symphony at Headquarters, MaKey-MaKeys at Cliff Cave, Healthy Living for Seniors at Daniel Boone, and Halloween Story time at Headquarters. Nicole Clawson added to the information on the Makey-MaKeys.
		Library Employee Update
		·        The Library Staff Association’s annual holiday food drive to benefit Operation Food Search began on November 4 and continues until December 31, 2014.  Both staff and patrons may participate in this food drive.  Last year the St. Louis County Library collected 7120 pounds of food.
		·        The Library’s actuary, Milliman, is reviewing the Library’s Pension Plan assumptions.  The Pension Board will meet in December to discuss their report.
		·        The Administrative staff is working on the 2015 action plan for the Strategic Plan.
		·        The Administrative staff and managers have been discussing the possibility of unrest in the region in the next couple of weeks and the impact it may have on our locations. Ms. Sorth said that the safety of employees is our utmost concern.  While we do not want to unnecessarily frighten anyone, we do want to be prepared.  We have communicated with both managers and staff and have provided them with information.  Managers have contacted their local police departments to ask questions about emergency procedures.  Managers have also been empowered to make decisions in an emergency situation.  Plans are in place to support the community in the event of school closings.  Operation Food Search, the Magic House and Lutheran Family Services have been contacted and the Library is prepared to offer programming as it did during school closures in August.
		Library Facility Update
		·        Ms. Sorth reported that work on repair of the handrails at Headquarters is complete.
		·        The repair of the concrete pad around the fuel pump at Headquarters is complete.
		·        Last month, Ms. Sorth had mentioned the severe damage to three of the four compressors which operate the cooling system at Lewis and Clark.  After investigating several options, administration decided that we will not invest any further money into the repair of the cooling system at Lewis and Clark because the equipment cannot be used in the new facility.  We will address the temperature in the building as we approach the summer months and may choose to close early on days when the temperature is uncomfortable.

		Communications has offered support to the Library Foundation by publicizing author events, and programs producing promotional materials for author events, producing program flyers for the annual Gala, maintaining the Foundation’s website, and working on the rebranding project. Communications staff makes good use of advertising, the website, eBlasts and social media to promote Library services and programs and attract new patrons. Over 76,000 program promotional emails are sent each month and the Library has received over 7.5 million web views so far this year. The Library also has almost 9,000 Facebook fans and 6,000 followers on Twitter with an average of 100 new fans being added each month.

Mr. Hunter stated that foundation work is currently underway at Grant’s View and steel is expected to arrive in December. August 2015 is the target date for completion of this project.
		Site grading, installation of footings and the retaining wall are currently underway at Lewis and Clark. August 2015 is also the target date for completion of this new building although demolition of the existing building and the resulting site work will extend the anticipated project completion date to December 2015. Web cameras have been installed at both construction sites and will show pictures of the progress every 15 minutes.
		Branch renovation plans are on time and under budget. The planning team has been meeting once a week since August to determine how to prepare collections for storage, secure a storage facility and notify staff and patrons. Mr. Hunter stated that the full plan will be presented to the Board in December.
		Library Card Campaign
		Eric Button presented a report on the library card campaign that ran from August through October this year. Mr. Button stated that it had been five years since the previous card campaign.
		The goal was to issue 25% more library cards in August, September and October this year than had been issued during the same time period in 2013. During the campaign, staff made countless visits to schools, contacted businesses, churches and other religious institutions, and attended community events. A new library card design and promotional materials were created.
		The Library’s new online registration module played an important role in the card campaign since it allowed customers to directly enter their information and obtain a temporary library card number. A separate version of the online application was also made available to schools to facilitate library card registration for students. Mr. Button stated that the card campaign was very successful and resulted in a 54% increase in the number of cards issued. In addition, 72% of the people being issued new cards had begun using them by the beginning of November.
		Dr. Beckwith said that he appreciated the Library’s outreach efforts and was pleased to hear how many people had used their new library cards.
