		PUBLIC COMMENT
		There were no public comments.
		TREASURER'S REPORT
		Kris Mooney reported that the Library District received $183,512 in September from Charter Communications. The remaining e-rate discounts should be received in October and November of 2014 and the total will be close to the budget of $305,000.
		The Library paid Aschinger Electric $11,378 in September for individual projects, which included light bulb replacement at Jamestown Bluffs and Natural Bridge, preventative testing at Bridgeton Trails and Grand Glaize, and lighting panel replacement at Cliff Cave. $2,780 was paid to Dannegger Brothers for sidewalk repairs at Natural Bridge.
		Replacement laptops for staff were purchased for $16,486 from CDW Government (CDW-G) in September.  The laptops were purchased under a government cooperative purchasing contract.
		$11,232 was paid to Comprise Technologies, Inc. for the Library’s annual renewal of Smart Money Manager software, terminal licenses, and technical support.  This is our point of sale software and cash drawer system to receive payment for fines and payments at the Circulation Desk.  The District spent $3,450 to renew Smart Shield & Remote Manager licenses with Centurion Holdings.  The software reduces the risk of Library computers exposure to malware and other viruses.
		The Library District’s second interest payment for 2014 on the Certificates of Participation was due October 1st.  Funds were transferred in the amount of $985,233 to our trustee, BOK Financial, on September 22nd.
		Capital Projects Fund Balance Sheet
		Total Construction in Progress for September 2014 was $28,690. The expenses included were payments to the St. Louis County Treasurer for construction and special use permits related to the new Grants View Branch.
		The Library Board approved the Treasurer’s Report subject to audit (Cunnane/Kenyon).
		DIRECTOR'S REPORT
		Kristen Sorth gave the following report.
		Facilities Master Plan Update
		Grant’s View
		Ms. Sorth began the Director’s report with a PowerPoint presentation of photographs showing the excavation at Grant’s View Branch site.  She explained that a report on activity at the site will be updated monthly. Ms. Sorth stated that sitework continues and excavation for the building foundations has begun. Steel fabrication is also underway. Next steps include setting rebar cages and pouring column pads. Zero dollars have been committed from the contingency fund the Board approved in August.
		Lewis and Clark
		Ms. Sorth’s PowerPoint presentation included pictures of the temporary construction fencing that has been installed.  She also reported that construction permits have been issued.  Parking is very limited with only thirty-two available parking spots for patrons and staff.  Four of the thirty-two spots have been striped for accessible parking.  Heavy site demolition started Friday, October 17.  Next steps include preparing the site by stripping the existing paving and creating the building pad.  A groundbreaking ceremony will take place on Thursday, October 23 at 10:00 a.m.  Invitations have been sent to the Library Board, elected officials, school officials, the current staff at Lewis and Clark, construction partners and Library patrons.  Zero dollars have been committed from the contingency fund the Board approved in September.
		Ms. Sorth announced that the Library Foundation has agreed to fund webcams for both Grant’s View and Lewis and Clark.  Live video feeds of the construction will be available through the Library’s website.
		Renovations – Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Rock Road and Weber Road
		Ms. Sorth said that library staff has been meeting with the architects from Bond to begin design on the renovations in Phase 1.  The focus is on Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Rock Road and Weber Road.  Construction on these four branches will begin in early 2015.  Plans are underway to address moving and storing collections and equipment during these renovations when the branches are closed.  The Library Board will be reviewing these options at a future meeting.  A media plan is also in development to update staff and patrons regarding closures and construction progress.
		Ms. Sorth gave the following Library update.
		·         The “dashboard” report for October contains a variety of statistical information for the Library. This month the report includes statistics about circulation, visits, programming, hourly averages for checked out material, public PC and WiFi usage trends and the most popular items from our collection.  This month it also contains information about patron requests.  Ms. Sorth also mentioned that September 2014 was the busiest September in the history of the St. Louis County Library with total circulation reaching 1,227,325 items.  This is significant because September tends to be a slower month.  We are attributing this increase to the ongoing Library card campaign.   The “dashboard” report was shared with the Board.
		·         Last month, Ms. Sorth mentioned that the Library has established a partnership with St. Louis BWorks.  The six week long Earn-A-Computer program at our Rock Road Branch started October 7th and will cover topics such as Internet safety, computer programming, and creating and delivering presentations on the PC. The class was filled within 24 hours of registration opening.   Students attending all six sessions and meeting the participation requirements will receive a complete PC system funded by the Library Foundation.  The students currently enrolled are a mix of 4th to 8th grade boys and girls.  Students attending are from Florissant, St. Ann, Clayton, Overland, Normandy, Affton, Jennings, Spanish Lake and Maryland Heights.
		·         Operation Food Search is interested in working with the library to offer the free lunch program during the summer months of 2015 at several locations including FV, GG, NB, and PC.  Several of the other eligible branch locations will be unable to host the program due to building closures and construction.  Rooms have already been set aside at these four locations.
		·         The logo has been designed for the early literacy initiative called Born to Read to engage our youngest readers and their parents.  We are partnering with four area hospitals (DePaul, Missouri Baptist, St. Anthony’s and St. Claire) to reach thousands of newborns by introducing them to a lifelong love of books and reading.  The program provides each new family with a gift bag consisting of a book, a bath toy and information on developing reading skills at an early age. The Foundation has enthusiastically agreed to help sponsor this new program that was announced at the Library’s Gala.
		·         The theater group at the St. Louis Community College at Meramec is conducting a book drive to support the Library’s Sweet Reads program.  Ms. Sorth shared the promotional flier with the Board.
		·         Ms. Sorth announced that the St. Louis County Library Foundation is celebrating its 15th anniversary this year. Special events will be scheduled throughout the fall.  On Monday, November 10 at 7:00 p.m. at Library Headquarters, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra will give a special free performance captured live on canvas by renowned plein air artist Billyo O'Donnell.
		·         The Natural Bridge Great Streets program has started.  Traffic on Natural Bridge is permanently reduced from four lanes to one lane in each direction.  The work on this project impacts the Natural Bridge Branch.
		·         Outreach and Lewis and Clark staff along with a Circulation staff member will attend a dinner this fall for teachers, parents and students of Hazelwood Middle School.  The dinner is arranged by Homeworks and will provide staff with an opportunity to speak about library services.
		·         The Budget Committee has been meeting to discuss the 2015 Library Budget.  The budget will be presented to the Library Board as an informational item at the November Board Meeting.  The approval of the Budget will be an action item at the December Board Meeting.
		·         Ms. Sorth said that there were two articles in the St. Louis Post Dispatch about the St. Louis County Library.  Both articles were shared with the Board.  The first was regarding the Library’s construction plans and the second was about reciprocal borrowing.
		·         Ms. Sorth showed photographs taken at several programs and events, Grant’s View groundbreaking, Star Wars Reads Day, Anime Con at Jamestown Bluffs, and the Diwali Celebration at Thornhill.
		Library Employee Update.
		·         Ms. Sorth stated that the Library’s In-Service Day was held on October 13th.  There were 453 employees in attendance.   The event is mandatory for full time employees and optional for part-time employees.  Vice President of the Library Board, Edith Cunnane, welcomed the employees.  Jim Kirchherr from the Nine Network was our keynote speaker and talked about St. Louis History.  There was also a presentation about the strategic plan, the construction plans and a question and answer period with administrative staff.  There were several breakout sessions on a variety of topics for employees to attend.  The Employee of the Year award was presented to Freddie Carter.  Freddie is a full time Custodian at the Thornhill Branch and was nominated by several co-workers.  The nominators stated that Freddie is “Thornhill’s custodian, mechanic, fixer, repairer, security guard and program assistant.”  Mr. Carter was in attendance and was introduced to the Board.  He thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak and said he appreciated being named the Employee of the Year.  Board members congratulated Freddie Carter and gave him a standing ovation.
		·         Ms. Sorth announced that we will not have an In-Service Day in 2015 due to the number of construction projects and branch closures.
		·         Ms. Sorth said that she along with Barbara Brain, Gib Van Cleve, and Kris Mooney attended the Missouri Library Association’s Awards Dinner on October 9th.  She accepted the Missouri Library of the Year award on behalf of the staff of the St. Louis County Library.  The award was circulated for the Board to admire.
		·         Mary Arnhart and Ms. Sorth met with representatives from Moneta to discuss the Library’s 457 Plan benefit for Library employees.   As the Trustee of the Plan, Ms. Sorth will meet with Moneta yearly to discuss investment performance and employee participation.
		·         Approximately 200 employees participated in the employee wellness screenings as part of the Wellness Program approved by the Library Board at the May 2014 Board Meeting.  Administration has received great feedback on the program and some employees have been alerted to issues that they will discuss with their health care professional.
		·         The Library had a very successful United Way campaign this year.  Ms. Sorth expressed thanks to Sandy Williams for organizing the Library’s campaign which raised $17,459.50.
		Library Facility Update.
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that work on repair of the handrails at HQ is almost complete.
		·         The repair of the concrete pad around the fuel pump at HQ is in progress.
		·         On the evening of September 8, Facilities staff responded to a call about warm temperatures in the Lewis & Clark Branch.  While on site, staff learned that the cooling system was not working due to an electrical issue.  A large 400 amp circuit breaker had been tripped, apparently due to a significant surge in electricity supplied to the building.  After flipping the breaker back on, staff could see that the chiller unit was operating, so they proceeded back inside to complete the configuration of the system.  At that time, staff in several parts of the building heard a large pop that they later determined was an electrical transformer near the building that had exploded.  The majority of the branch lost electricity at that time.  Ameren was contacted and their crew arrived on site and determined that the power supply to the building had been damaged when the transformer blew.  The library closed to the public and an overnight repair by Ameren restored power to the building for the following day (September 9).  It was not until much later in the month that new problems came to light.  Apparently when the power surge hit the branch on September 8, it severely damaged three of the four compressors which operate the cooling system.   We are working on a solution to this issue.
		·         Ms. Sorth said for the last several years, we have discussed solutions for the Mid County plaza where the retaining wall has started to deteriorate.   The concrete steps next to the wall are blocked off during winter months due to safety concerns.  We have engaged the services of an engineer to develop proposed solutions which will be brought to the Library Board at the December Board Meeting.
		·         We are adding some much needed landscaping at the Bridgeton Trails Branch.  Many trees were damaged during a tornado and had to be removed.  The appearance of the parking lot and green space suffered greatly and was the source of many patron comments.
		Ms. Sorth announced the following upcoming author events.
		·         Nancy Carver, "Making Tracks: The Untold Story of Horse Racing in St. Louis", Monday, October 27, 7:00 p.m. Library Headquarters – Auditorium.
		·         Julius Hunter, “Priscilla & Babe: From Slavery’s Shackles to Millionaire Bordello Madams in Victorian St. Louis”, Wednesday, October 29, 7:00 p.m. Library Headquarters – Auditorium.

		Reference Department
		Christina Pryor, Manager of the Reference Department, gave a Power Point presentation on the work of her department.  Ms. Pryor explained that her staff can be contacted by telephone, email, chat and text as well as face to face. The roving reference service offers another point of contact for customers with reference questions. Reference statistics show that the department answered over 40,000 questions in the previous year with 60% of those transactions taking place over the phone. Reference staff receives a wide variety of questions but does not answer medical or legal questions. Ms. Pryor stated that electronic resources play an increasingly important role in Reference Department work. Many reference print materials are being replaced with electronic databases and staff also assists customers to access the Library’s emedia resources. The popular Book a Librarian program gives customers the opportunity to receive one-on-one assistance on specific topics such as conducting a job search or using a particular database. The department also houses a government documents collection and offers readers advisory assistance. In Sept 2012, the department created the Mind Your Business small business lecture series in partnership with the MU Extension Small Business & Technology Center. Dr. Beckwith thanked Ms. Pryor for her presentation.
		2015-2018 Strategic Plan
		Library Planner Marie Conlin presented an overview of the Library’s 2015-2018 Strategic Plan.  Ms. Conlin stated that, in 2013, the Library contracted with Vector Communications to provide the public engagement portion of the planning work. This process involved focus groups with adult patrons, teen patrons, community groups, library staff and managers. The public (including non users), staff and Library Board were also surveyed. The majority of the public surveyed were aware of most of the Library’s standard services but it became clear that several services, such as Book a Librarian and homebound services were not well known.
		After surveying staff regarding possible changes to the mission statement, it was decided that the existing mission is still relevant. However, Ms. Conlin explained that the focus will be on using the tag line:  Enriching minds, Enhancing lives, Expanding perspectives as it captures our ideals and should be easier to remember.
		Staff was also asked to rank 13 value statements to determine which ones resonated most closely with library staff.  The five values chosen were: Customer Service Excellence; Lifelong Learning; Advocate for Youth; Community Engagement and Integrity.
		Increase Literacy, Strengthen Sense of Community/ Improve Social Connectedness and Create Gathering Spaces were the areas of focus that came out of the public engagement process. Ms. Conlin explained that goals and objectives were then developed for each of the areas of focus and the next steps will include forming a committee to work on developing activities for 2015 that support the plan with a goal of creating measuring activities.  The committee will reconvene each year to create activities for the following year.
		Mr. Sachs requested that the previous plan be sent to him for comparison purposes.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to approve the 2015-2018 St. Louis County Library Strategic Plan. This plan will be the foundation for operational plans for the next three years (Tai/Kenyon).
		Snow Removal Services
		Eric Button presented the Administration’s recommendation on snow removal services. Mr. Button reported that the Library has been contracted with its current snow removal company for three years. An Invitation for Bid was issued on September 1, 2014 for three years of snow removal services at all St. Louis County Library (SLCL) locations except Meramec Valley. Invitations were sent to seventeen companies, a notice was placed on the SLCL web site, and an ad was placed in the Post-Dispatch. Respondents were asked to provide costs broken down per location per event based on the amount of snow and the type of service provided.
		Two responses were received.
		Mr. Button explained that payments in a given year fluctuate since snow removal services are used on an as-needed basis and payments are made only when services are rendered. $70,000 is being budgeted in the 2015 Building Operation budget to cover these expenses.
		The Library Board approved the recommendation to select the lowest and best bid from BSR Services to perform snow removal services at nineteen SLCL locations for a period of three years. BSR had excellent references, including the St. Louis Rams, Express Scripts, and Edward Jones. The Board also authorized the Director to enter into and execute a contract to that effect. Expenses incurred for these services will be deducted from the Building Operation budget. (Sachs/Kenyon).
		Evening Custodial Services
		Eric Button presented a recommendation for approval of a contract for evening custodial services. He reported that the current company has been providing these services since 2009. An Invitation for Bid was issued on September 1, 2014 for three years of evening custodial services at sixteen St. Louis County Library (SLCL) locations. The specifications prohibit the respondent from subcontracting the work. Invitations were sent to twenty-two companies, a notice was placed on the SLCL web site, and an ad was placed in the Post-Dispatch. Respondents were asked to provide monthly pricing broken down by location. Four responses were received.
		4M Building Solutions does not subcontract and has demonstrated capacity to meet the Library’s needs. In addition to solid references, including Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), Graybar Electric, and Ameren, SLCL has had positive experiences with 4M from a time when they provided temporary custodial support at two locations. It is anticipated that evening custodial services will not be needed for extended periods of time in 2015 at several locations due to the impact of construction projects and reassignment of custodial staff during closures.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to select 4M Building Solutions for evening custodial services for a period of three years at a monthly cost of $22,472 and an annual cost of $269,664. The Board also authorized the Director to enter into and execute a contract to that effect. This expense is budgeted in the Building Operation budget and will be included in the 2015 budget (Cunnane/Tai).
		Aye: Lynn Beckwith, Dr Chingling Tai, Edith Cunnane, Elena G Kenyon
		Nay: Steve Sachs
		Unassigned Fund Balance
		Kris Mooney presented the Administration’s recommendation to approve an amendment to the current Unassigned Fund Balance Policy.  Mr. Mooney explained that the unassigned fund balance is the amount of net assets available for use in any of the Library District’s funds. These funds are not restricted or assigned for any particular future use. The target range of the District’s unassigned balance is between 15% and 20% of budgeted operating expenditures with a specific target of 17.5%.
		The Government Finance Officers Organization (GFOA) recommends that organizations establish a policy that defines the process in the event the unassigned fund balance drops below or goes above the intended range. Our current Unassigned Fund Balance Policy addresses the process if the unassigned fund balance falls below 15% but does not address what the Library District intends to do if the unassigned fund balance goes over 20%.
		After consultation with KEB, the Library’s auditors, the Administration recommends that, if the unassigned fund balance goes above the 20% maximum, the Library District will place the amount over 20% in a restricted fund to be used for facility acquisition, construction or other capital improvements as approved by the Library Board. Documents showing the recommended changes as well as an updated policy were shown to the Board.
		The Library Board approved the amendment to the current Unassigned Fund Balance Policy to restrict any unassigned funds above the 20% maximum to be used only for facility acquisition, construction or other capital improvements as approved by the Library Board. The 2014 Library Budget estimates an unassigned fund balance of $14,399,671 which is 36.3% (Kenyon/Cunnane).
		15th and Final Contract for Construction of New Lewis & Clark Branch
		Steve Hunter recommended Board approval of the lowest and best bid from X-L Contracting on the final work package for the new Lewis & Clark Branch. Mr. Hunter explained that final construction documents for the project were delivered by KAI on August 15, 2014. The work was organized into 15 separate work packages, which were released for bid on August 18, 2014. Bids were due September 3, 2014 and opened in a public meeting at Library Headquarters. The Board approved 14 of the 15 work packages at the September Board Meeting and it was stated then that a recommendation for Work Package #15 – Asphaltic Paving would be presented at a future meeting.
		Three qualified bids were received for Work Package #15. The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for the selection of the lowest and best bid from X-L Contracting, a 100% MBE contractor, at $114,308 and the Board authorized the Director to enter into and execute a contract to that effect (Sachs/Cunnane).
		Amendment to Real Estate Broker Contract
		Kristen Sorth presented a proposed Second Amendment to the Library’s agreement with Colliers International. Ms. Sorth reported that, in March of 2013, the Library selected Colliers to provide real estate broker services in connection with the District’s Facilities Master Plan. The Agreement with Colliers was approved in April of 2013. The Library made the decision to close branches during renovation in order to accelerate completion of the projects, lower costs and address safety concerns. When the branches are closed and under renovation, the collections and equipment in the branches will have to be moved and stored at an offsite facility. Colliers will be assisting with the selection of the storage facility. The amendment adds the Storage Facility Lease as part of the Broker’s Engagement. The proposed amendment document as well as a Resolution authorizing the Second Amendment was shared with the Board.
		The Library Board approved the Resolution Approving the second Amendment to the Exclusive Real Estate Brokerage Services Representation Agreement with Colliers International (Cunnane/Sachs).
		Ceridian Upgrade
		Kristen Sorth reported that the Library is seeking approval to upgrade its payroll, pension and human resources information system. The Library currently uses Ceridian for payroll and pension administration as well as several human resources related modules including time and
		attendance, recruiting, employment screening and self service. The Library also uses Ceridian
		for payroll and pension tax filings and for COBRA Administration. We have reviewed
		Ceridian’s new Dayforce HCM (human capital management) product and are recommending an
		upgrade to the new product. The single application will combine all of our current modules into
		one application and will also have additional functionality.
		The Library currently pays $13,256/month in recurring fees for services provided by Ceridian.
		If the upgrade is approved, the following fees will be included in the 2015 Library budget.
		Ceridian Dayforce HCM: One-time implementation fee - $68,500
		Ceridian Dayforce HCM Recurring Fees - $15,040/month
		Ms. Sorth explained that there is currently a waiting period to upgrade to Dayforce. The one-time fee along with an increase in the monthly fee will not be assessed until implementation which is estimated to be May or June 2015.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to upgrade to Ceridian Dayforce HCM for a one-time implementation fee of $68,500 and a monthly recurring fee of $15,040 and authorized the Director to enter into and execute a contract to that effect (Cunnane/Kenyon). This will be included in the 2015 budget. The pricing will remain in effect for 5 years.
		ADJOURN FOR EXECUTIVE SESSION
		Mrs. Cunnane made a motion to adjourn open meeting and to convene Executive Session to discuss real estate (Section 610.021(2)); and legal matters (Section 610.021(1)). Dr. Tai seconded.
		All approved by voice vote. Aye: Lynn Beckwith, Steve Sachs, Dr. Chingling Tai, Edith Cunnane, Elena G Kenyon.
		The Library Board meeting adjourned at 4:52 p.m.
		Respectfully submitted,
