DIRECTOR'S REPORT
Kristen Sorth gave the following report.
 · Ms. Sorth stated that the dashboard report for April contains a variety of statistical information about circulation, visits, programming and PC usage. Ms. Sorth shared the report with the Board. With three branches closed for construction, circulation is down 1% but visits are up 4.5%. The most notable statistics are in programming. Program sessions increased 8% over this same time last year and program attendance increased 40%. This month the report also includes information regarding circulation by media type. Children’s books circulate the most followed by DVDs and then adult books. The report also includes information about the most popular items in the collection.
 · The Library was selected as one of 12 libraries to join the Urban Libraries Council's Entrepreneur Peer Learning Cohort. Jennifer Gibson, Manager of Reference, and Ms. Sorth will work with the group to design and test approaches for supporting entrepreneurs especially people of color, women, immigrants, and veterans. Jennifer and Ms. Sorth will be traveling to the first meeting in Kansas City on April 19 and 20. After that, it will just be Jennifer who is involved with the cohort. ULC received a grant from the Kauffman Foundation and all travel expenses are paid for by ULC. (Plan: Increase Literacy 3.3)
 · The Library applied for and was selected to host an intern this summer as part of the Public Library Association's Inclusive Internship Initiative. This is an internship program designed to introduce young people from diverse backgrounds to careers in librarianship. With individual guidance from a mentor, the intern will engage with multiple facets of library life, from administration to programming to user services, while also completing a connected-learning project on behalf of their host library. PLA is only sponsoring 50 internships this summer. Neighborhood Branch Administrator, Alaina Culbertson, will serve as the mentor for this initiative. Alaina will participate in a webinar about the program on April 26. We will continue to update the Board on this initiative. The first step will be to develop a process for selecting our intern. (Plan: Increase Literacy 3)
· Ms. Sorth reported that the Library will offer Hip Hop Architecture Camp (HHAC) for 40 middle school kids (ages 11-14) this summer at the Natural Bridge Branch from July 30 – August 3. HHAC is designed to introduce underrepresented youth to architecture, urban planning, creative place making and economic development through the lens of hip hop culture. During the camp, students are paired with architects, urban planners, designers, and hip hop artists to create unique visions for their communities which include the creation of physical models, digital models and the creation of a Hip Hop Architecture track and music video summarizing their designs. We have worked with the St. Louis County Planning Department and have selected the area around the North Hanley Transit Center as the focus of the camp. The press release announcing the camp will go out next week and registration opens on May 1. (Plan: Increase Literacy 3.1)

NEW BUSINESS
CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
Steve Hunter gave an update on the construction projects and also updated the Board on the Grant's View Branch road construction.
There are currently four projects under construction including Grand Glaize, Mid-County, Thornhill, and Meramec Valley.
SERVICE TO SENIORS PRESENTATION
Crystal Harris, Manager of Bookmobiles and Mobile Service, gave an overview of the various services offered to the senior population. Her presentation also included information about services for the homebound population.
Service for patrons who can't attend the library is a priority for the department. Vans used for senior service are now being retired and are being replaced with 2018 Ram ProMasters. There are four staff members assigned to senior services and nearly 24,000 patrons are serviced yearly at 102 locations. Currently, there are 20 additional locations on the waiting list. The Library also has a Homebound Mailing Service used for approximately 164 homebound patrons.
Ms. Harris reported that the Library has a senior reminiscing program for patrons where kits are used for those suffering with dementia or Alzheimer’s. These special kits include hats, world series rings, etc. that are used to help patrons recall a special memory.
Board Treasurer Elena Kenyon thanked Crystal Harris for bringing quality programming to the seniors. Dr. Beckwith said the department was a very worthy service and he appreciated their efforts.
DIVERSITY REPORT
Kristen Sorth presented the annual informational Diversity Report on staff employment.
The Library Board has requested yearly information regarding the staff complement at the St. Louis County Library. Reports for 2017 and 2018 were shared with the Board and which include the following documents:
1. A report entitled “Summary Comparison Percentage Chart.” This report combines the data from the “Summary” report and reflects five years of data. It also includes FTE information for the same time frame.
2. A report entitled “List of Job Titles by Dept/Branch. This is a report that is generated from our HR/Payroll software. The “ethnicity” column contains descriptions designated in our software. The report is divided by department and branch. The departments are listed in alphabetical order beginning after Administration. The branches are next and they are also listed in alphabetical order. Within each branch or department employees are listed by their title only. Employees were sorted in descending order from the employee with the highest pay grade within the branch or department to the lowest pay grade. Individuals with the same title, have the same pay grade.
3. A one page summary of the above mentioned report entitled “Summary” that is also generated from our HR/Payroll system. This report lists the total number of employees as well as percentages. Several of the departments are grouped together on this report by organizational unit.
4. A report entitled “Staff Complement by Title Listing Race.” This document lists each title, the total number of employees with that title and then breaks down the percentage of that title by race. The titles are sorted in descending order from the title with the highest pay grade to the title with the lowest pay grade.
 5. A report entitled “Staff Complement by Title Listing Race and Gender.” This report is identical to the report mentioned above in number three with the exception that gender has been added to this report.
6. A report entitled “St. Louis County Library – List of New Hires by Location.” This report includes information about the candidates selected for all positions that were posted in this time frame. The report lists the hires by department or branch. I have indicated if a branch or department had no vacancies during that time frame.
Dr. Beckwith said the Library has made a marked improvement for diversity since he joined the Board in 2007. He credits the Director with the improvement and said he appreciated her pro-activeness. However, he was not happy with the current results. He would like the branches to think about diversity when hiring. Dr. Beckwith is concerned that the branches do not accurately reflect the communities that they serve. Branches with 10% or less diversity were mentioned.
Dr. Beckwith suggested contacting retired librarians from school districts. Ms. Sorth stated that the Library is making great efforts to attract minorities to all positions.  She stated that it is a team effort and all are working toward the same goal.
PEST CONTROL
Steve Hunter presented the Administration’s recommendation for pest control services at all 20 locations.
On March 29, 2018 Library Administration issued an IFB for monthly preventative Pest Control services across all branches. Responses were due April 10, 2018. The IFB was posted on our website, an ad was placed in the Post-Dispatch, and 13 firms were contacted directly via email. One firm provided a response.
Although only one firm responded, Administration is confident the Terminix response meets the requirements of the IFB. Their cost is competitive with the bids received the last time Pest Control was bid in 2016.
The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to select Terminix to provide preventative pest control services to the Library District for all 20 branches for the amount of $9,996 per year, and that it authorize the Director to enter into and execute a 3-year contract to that effect (Kenyon/Tai).
ADJOURNMENT
The Library Board adjourned at 4:32 p.m. (Mulligan/Tai). All gave voice approval.
Respectfully yours,
