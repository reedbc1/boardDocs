	TREASURER’S REPORT
	Kris Mooney reported that the Library District incurred $80,362 in expense in August for
	the purchase of DVD’s to add to the general collection. Mr. Mooney explained that the increase was due to several popular movie titles being released in recent months.
	The Library District incurred $7,392 in bindery expense in August. In the past, the Library has bound older copies in conjunction with new titles as they arrive. This effort to bind older titles should last through the remainder of 2015.
	The Library District purchased a self service scanning and faxing machine in August at a cost of $5,290. Known as “Simple Scan”, this purchase is part of a larger purchase to eventually install these stations in all branches. Funds for a majority of the remaining purchases will come from bond proceeds. The Board approved the purchase of this equipment at the June meeting.
	In August, the Library District spent $59,835 for the renewal of several annual maintenance agreements. The renewals included:
	·         KACE Software - Used to push software updates and patches to all customer and staff
	            computers.
	·         Smart Money Manager – Point of Sale software used to record cash transactions at all
	            Library branches.
	·         Google Apps – Library District e-mail and other Google applications.
	Capital Projects Fund Balance Sheet
	Total Construction in Progress for August 2015 was $1,652,259. The expenses included payments for:

	The Library Board approved the Treasurer’s Report subject to audit. (Cunnane/Tai).
	DIRECTOR'S REPORT
	Kristen Sorth gave the following report.
	Library update
	·         Ms. Sorth said that the dashboard report for September contains a variety of statistical information for the Library.  The report was shared with the Board. This month the report includes information about circulation and visits.  With five branches closed, circulation dropped 6.5% over August 2014.  This month, the report also includes information about programming, PC usage and cardholders.  In terms of PC use, Florissant Valley is the busiest branch and Bridgeton Trails has the highest increase over 2014 at 73%.  The most popular items in the collection were also included.
	·         Patron surveys were distributed to branches included in Phase 2 of the construction projects.  The branches included in Phase 2 are Bridgeton Trails, Daniel Boone, Florissant Valley, Grand Glaize, Meramec Valley, Mid-County and Thornhill. Surveys will be available online and in print. In addition, there will be a link to the survey on branch computers.  Patrons may comment on what changes they would like to see in their branch.  Employees at those branches are also providing feedback.
	·         The Library is offering four programs this month to help teens prepare for college.  Julie Kampschroeder, a college counselor in the Pattonville School District, will offer tips on topics ranging from finding the right school to obtaining financial aid.  The final program will be a college fair with representatives from several Missouri colleges and universities.
	·         Ms. Sorth was asked to participate in an all day planning session on September 30 regarding the For the Sake of All report.  The purpose of the event is to convene a diverse group of stakeholders to identify how the region can take action in the six areas of recommendation identified in the report.  Those include early childhood, economic opportunity, school-based health and youth development, healthy neighborhoods, mental health, and disease prevention and management.
	·         From September 14 – October 7, the Library will host a promotion with the Fox Theater for “Matilda the Musical” based on the book by Roald Dahl.  During this time, each branch will have a display featuring books by Roald Dahl.  The Fox has also donated tickets for a raffle.  Ten different winners will receive a 4-pack of tickets to the production.
	·         As the branches in Phase 1 of the construction projects open, we will implement a new way to file materials that have been requested by patrons and are available for self pick-up.  The patron identifier for those materials will be changed in a way that protects the confidentiality of our patrons by keeping their reading, listening and viewing requests as private as possible.  Patrons may also choose an alias as their identifier.
	·         Ms. Sorth said that, in order to ensure that all staff are kept informed and have access to critical information pertaining to the reopening of branches, a Google document that is continually updated and expanded was created and shared.  The document provides answers to many questions and helps each department of the library understand the role they play in the overall effort.
	·         The Library was contacted in late August by the Ferguson Commission Media and Communications staff.  They were looking for ways to ensure public access to the Commission's findings. We have added a link to the "digital first" report of the Ferguson Commission.  We will also have 10 print copies of the 15-20 page Executive Summary available for the public at each of the open branches and a couple of copies of the full 200 page report at HQ.
	·         Ms. Sorth was contacted by Doug Wolter, the Horticulture Supervisor for St. Louis County Parks.  Mr. Wolter is involved with Missourians for Monarchs, which is a concerted statewide effort to create monarch waystations throughout the flyway.  Monarch waystations are places that provide resources necessary for monarchs to produce successive generations and sustain their migration.  The organization would like the library to be involved in the discussion and promotion of the initiative.  I will attend a meeting with various organizations and officials at the end of the month.
	·         Barbara Brain has revised the school service agreements for bookmobile service.  Language has been added regarding the need for school personnel to accompany children on the bookmobile and also to allow bookmobile staff entry into the building if the need arises.  Both of these revisions are to ensure the safety of Library employees.
	·         The St. Louis County Library Foundation presented the 2015 Sidney Johnson Learning Award to local teen De'Angelo Jones for his outstanding volunteer service at the Florissant Valley Branch of St. Louis County Library. The Foundation presented the award to De'Angelo, along with a $1,000 check at the Starcatchers Gala on September 19.  De'Angelo was nominated for the Sidney Johnson award because of his exceptional volunteer work. Since May 2014, he has worked more than 600 hours, helping during a particularly busy time for the branch. De'Angelo helped reorganize the family literacy kits and also helped with the branch's free lunch program this summer.  In addition to volunteering at the library, De’Angelo, who is a junior, is active at McCluer North High School in the band and color guard. He is also the president of McCluer's Gay Straight Alliance Club. He is a graduate of ServiceWorks, a program which promotes student leaders and equips them with opportunities to learn life and leadership skills.   A total of 21 teens were nominated for this year's award. The Sidney Johnson Learning award recognizes library service by a teen and is in memory of Lewis & Clark staff member, Sidney Johnson, who was killed in 2007.
	·         There were additional mentions of the St. Louis County Library in the local media and those articles were shared with the Board.
	·         Ms. Sorth also shared a number of photographs with the Board from several programs and events including: Grandparents with Grandchildren at Daniel Boone, Senator McCaskill at HQ, Math with Clifford at Thornhill, Papermaking at Cliff Cave, Dav Pilkey at HQ, Sensory Lap Time at HQ and Family Read Night at HQ.
	Library Employee Update
	·         Ms. Sorth reported that former Branch Manager, Dottie Wobbe, will receive the Meritorious Award at the Missouri Library Association’s annual meeting in October. The award recognizes an individual who has made a significant contribution to libraries in Missouri.  Dottie retired in November, 2014 after 43 years at St. Louis County Library.  During her time here, she was a Branch Manager at six different branches.
	·         Jennifer Ilardi, Youth Services Specialist at the Florissant Valley Branch, will receive the 2015 Show Me Youth Services Award at the Missouri Library Association’s annual meeting in October.  The award recognizes a library employee, friend, or trustee who serves and/or advocates for children or young adults and who demonstrates notable and outstanding performance in planning, developing, and promoting programs, services, collections, reading activities or advocating for children and/or teenagers in their libraries and communities.

	2015 TAX RATES
	Kris Mooney reported that the Library Administration has reviewed the 2015 post Board of Equalization (BOE) property value assessments. Property values have increased over the prior year in total by 2.9%.
	The Board is reminded that the 2015 tax revenue along with the surtax on commercial property will provide approximately 95% of the cash income needed to operate in 2016. According to State Statute, the Board must set the 2015 tax rates by October 1, 2015.
	Historically, the Library District has not charged the full voter approved tax ceiling in the Residential Real Estate category and Administration is proposing to do the same for the 2015 rate.
	The table below shows the calculated tax rate ceiling for each property category and the amount the Library District is voluntary reducing in the Residential category:
	                                    Tax Rate Ceiling     Voluntary Reduction    Proposed Tax Rates for 2015 Residential                                $ 0.260                  $ 0.010                                $ 0.250
	Agricultural                             $ 0.239                   $ -                                       $ 0.239
	Commercial                             $ 0.259                   $ -                                       $ 0.259
	Personal Property                    $ 0.225                   $ -                                       $ 0.225
	The Library Board approved the Resolution which states the above proposed tax rates listed for all subclasses of real estate and personal property are assessed as the 2015 tax rates. If, after validation by the Missouri State Auditor, the tax rate ceiling allowed for any or all subclasses is less than or greater than the approved rate(s) the Director is hereby authorized to set the final rate (s) for the Library as validated by the State of Missouri Auditor. The revenue generated by these rates will allow the District to continue providing excellent service to our customers and will provide for the repayment of debt from our issuance of Certificates of Participation in April, 2013 (Kenyon/Tai).
	The State Auditor confirmed the rates after the board meeting.  The following rates were certified per the board’s authorization to set fiscal rates submitted by the State Auditor.
	Residential                   .2460
	Agricultural                 .2390
	Commercial                 .2590
	Personal Property        .2250
	2015 BUDGET REVISION
	Kris Mooney presented the 2015 budget revision. Mr. Mooney named the Budget Committee members:
	Kristen Sorth               Director
	Barbara Brain              Assistant Director, Adult & Support Services

	Mr. Mooney stated that the committee has reviewed the 2015 Budget. Revenue will increase by approximately $1.4 million and expenditures will decrease by approximately $516,000. Account changes are explained within the Budget Revision narrative and summary Statement of Revenues and Expenditures that were shared with the Board.
	The Library Board approved the Budget Committee’s recommendations on the 2015 Revised Budget (Cunnane/Tai).
	ST. LOUIS COUNTY LIBRARY FOUNDATION BYLAW REVISIONS
	Kristen Sorth presented a recommendation to approve revisions to the Library Foundation’s Bylaws. Ms. Sorth reported that the Library Board of Directors is required to approve any such changes. The Library Foundation Board is proposing changes to the bylaws that will accurately describe the operations of the Foundation, serve as effective guidelines for the organization, verify consistency with laws, simplify language, eliminate redundancies and remove outdated concepts. The revisions were reviewed by Lashly Baer and approved by the Foundation Board on September 8, 2015. The major changes to the by-laws include the following:
	Numbers of Directors - Changes the ranges from 21-27 to 18-27 directors.
	Appointed Directors - Describes the responsibility of Library Board Trustees to appoint the Library Director to the Foundation Board; facilitating communications between Library, Trustees and Foundation. Trustees have discretionary right to appoint one additional director. Terms of elected Directors - Change simplifies procedure for electing directors and for directors’ terms.
	Filling vacancies - Change simplifies language. When need arises, Governance Committee vets and recommends people to fill vacancies and proposes that the Board elect a new director by majority vote, with a director’s term beginning when an election is final.
	Director removal – Change provides that a director may be removed when it is in the best interest of Foundation, rather than listing actions that may lead to removal.
	A document with changes tracked and a final version were shared with the Board.
	The Library Board approved the revisions to the Library Foundation’s Bylaws as approved by the Foundation Board on September 8, 2015 (Cunnane/Kenyon).
	LEWIS AND CLARK CONTINGENCY
	Steve Hunter reported that, in July 2015, the Board approved moving funds from the overall Phase 1 Program contingency to the Lewis & Clark project-specific contingency to cover costs of unforeseen underground abatement related to the removal of the original building and to address groundwater under the parking lot.
	Mr. Hunter explained that additional groundwater has appeared at the extreme southwest corner of the property and the funds approved in July are not sufficient to complete this additional, unforeseen work. A transfer of $175,000 from the overall Phase I contingency to the Lewis & Clark project-specific contingency will more accurately match cost projections. These funds have previously been authorized as part of the original $58M Phase I Certificates of Participation. There is no impact on the budgets for the remaining Phase 1 projects.
	The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for the transfer of $175,000 from the Phase 1 Program contingency to the Lewis & Clark project-specific contingency (Cunnane/Tai).
	PHASE 2 ARCHITECTS
	Steve Hunter reported that the Library Administration requested the submission of qualifications from qualified firms to provide Architectural and Engineering Services for eight Phase 2 projects. Lashly Baer and Landmark assisted with the development of two Requests for Qualifications (RFQ). The first was for work at Daniel Boone, Bridgeton Trails, Florissant Valley, Meramec Valley, Grand Glaize, and Thornhill; the second for work at Mid-County and a new Operations Center.
	The RFQs were issued on July 21, 2015 with responses due on August 7, 2015. Thirty-two responses were received. Mr. Hunter stated that Selection Procedures for Architects and Engineers are clearly defined by Missouri State Statute and described in the Library District’s Policy II for Professional Services. These procedures were shared with the Board.
	A selection committee consisting of Kristen Sorth, Barbara Brain, Eric Button, Steve Hunter, and Scott Kolath from Landmark reviewed the proposals. Based on their rankings, representatives from eight firms were interviewed during the week of August 24, 2015. Following the interviews, the selection committee deliberated over the best fit for each project.
	The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for dividing the awards for Architectural and Engineering Services for Phase 2 to three different firms.
	1.  The Library Board approved the selection of Christner Architects to provide Architectural and Engineering services for the new Mid-County Branch and authorized the Director to enter into and execute a contract to that effect. Christner’s negotiated fee is $767,895 (Cunnane/Tai).
	II. The Library Board approved the selection of Cannon Design to provide Architectural and Engineering services for the new Operations Center and authorized the Director to enter into and execute a contract to that effect. Cannon’s negotiated fee is $938,270 (Cunnane/Kenyon).
	 III. The Library Board approved the selection of Bond Architects to provide Architectural and Engineering services for the new Thornhill and Meramec Valley branches, and for renovations at the Florissant Valley, Bridgeton Trails, Daniel Boone, and Grand Glaize Branches and authorized the Director to enter into and execute a contract to that effect. Bond’s negotiated fee is $2,897,426. (Cunnane/Kenyon).
	PHASE 2 CONSTRUCTION MANAGER
	Steve Hunter presented the Administration’s recommendation on Construction Management Services for Phase 2 of the Facilities Master Plan. The Library Administration requested the submission of proposals from qualified firms to provide Construction Management Services for eight Phase 2 projects. Lashly & Baer and Landmark assisted with the drafting of the Request for Proposal (RFP), which includes work at the Florissant Valley, Bridgeton Trails, Daniel Boone, Thornhill, Mid-County, Meramec Valley, and Grand Glaize Branches and for the new Operations Center.
	The RFP was issued on July 21, 2015 with responses due on August 21, 2015. Four responses were received. Mr. Hunter stated that the Selection Procedures and evaluation factors for Construction Management Services are clearly defined by Missouri State Statute and were followed during this process.
	A selection committee consisting of Kristen Sorth, Steve Hunter, and Scott Kolath from Landmark reviewed the proposals. Representatives from all four responding firms were interviewed the week of August 31, 2015. Following the interviews, firms were ranked and the selection committee reached a consensus.
	The Library Board approved the selection of Brinkmann Constructors to provide Construction Management Services for Phase 2 of the Facilities Master Plan for $3,788,033 and authorized the Director to enter into and execute a contract to that effect. (Cunnane/Tai).
	LIBRARY CODE OF CONDUCT
	Barbara Brain reported that several minor changes had been made to the Code of Conduct to remove dated information and to add a couple of points not specifically addressed in the current version of the policy that was approved by the Board on July 21, 2014.
	Ms. Brain gave examples of the changes such as the addition of statements regarding the consumption of alcoholic beverages and intoxication, a prohibition on the consumption of food at Library computers and the requirement that drinks be in covered containers. The policy statement was reviewed by legal counsel and a copy with all changes tracked was shared with the Board.
	The Library Board approved the revisions to the Library Code of Conduct (Tai/Cunnane).
	GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE
	Mary Arnhart reported that, according to the Personnel Manual, the Library Board appoints two employees to the Grievance Committee for four-year terms. One employee is appointed in even numbered years and the other in odd numbered years. Terms of the Grievance Committee commence on October 1.
	Ms. Arnhart explained that Janet Rissmann is the current Board appointed employee serving on the Grievance Committee. Last year, the Board appointed her to fill a vacant position that had one year left on the term. Ms. Rissmann’s term will expire on September 30, 2015.
	The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to reappoint Janet Rissmann from the Samuel Sachs Branch to serve a new four-year term on the Grievance Committee. (Cunnane/Tai).
	2015 SALARY STRUCTURE ADJUSTMENTS AND MERIT RAISES
	Kristen Sorth presented the Administration’s recommendation for approval of a salary adjustment and merit raises for Library employees. Both the structure adjustment and merit raises will be included in the 2016 Library Budget. Ms. Sorth reported that the Library has been working with Lockton Companies, the Library’s Human Resources Consultant, on this recommendation.
	Ms. Sorth explained that each of the Library’s seventeen pay grades contains a minimum, midpoint and maximum salary. Each title is assigned to a pay grade. The increase to the structure adjustment recommended by Lockton for 2016 averages out to be 2% and will only affect employees new to the Library or new to their position. These individuals will not be eligible for a merit raise. Lockton conducted an analysis and identified 44 employees eligible to receive a structure adjustment at a cost of $15,397.
	Ms. Sorth also explained that the Library uses a performance management system where individual raises are tied directly to the level of performance for each employee. Through this process, managers can make real distinctions between levels of performance and reward employees accordingly. For 2016, a 0 – 4.5% merit raise range with a 2.9% average raise is recommended. Merit at this range costs $527,421. Only employees that have worked for the Library for one year or more are eligible for merit raises.
	The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for the salary adjustment based on the analysis conducted by Lockton. These adjustments will cost $542,819 for a 0 – 4.5% merit raise range with a 2.9% average. Salary adjustments approved last year cost $583,415. (Kenyon/Tai).
