		TREASURER’S REPORT
		Kris Mooney reported that the Library District received the second and final payment of $7,417 on the Technology Mini-Grant in May.  The grant funds were used to purchase nine Apple MacBooks, which were used in 30 programs throughout the grant period.
		Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags were purchased for $31,100 from Bayscan Technologies.  These supplies are generally replenished semi-annually and are placed on library materials for inventory and anti-theft purposes.
		Due to withheld funding by the Governor of the State of Missouri in 2014, the Library did not receive the discount on MORE.net membership and circuit costs for the year 2015.  The Governor released the funds in April 2015, and the District received a refund of $6,307.
		The annual renewal fee for the Decision Center statistical reporting tool for Millennium was paid in May.  The total cost came to $18,228.
		Capital Projects Fund Balance Sheet
		Total Construction in Progress for May 2015 was $2,586,750. The expenses included payments for:
		·         Renovation at Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Rock Road, and Weber Road (payable to many sub-contractors) - $834,890
		·         Grants View construction (payable to many sub-contractors) - $700,050
		·         Lewis and Clark construction (payable to many sub-contractors) – $572,298
		·         Professional services of the Construction Manager - $194,759
		·         Architect’s fees payable to Bond Architects, KAI, and Christner – $166,643
		·         The remaining dollars were largely spent for the services of the Facilities Master Plan Administrator, storage expenses, and environmental professional services.
		The Library Board approved the Treasurer's Report subject to audit (Sachs/Cunnane).
		DIRECTOR’S REPORT
		Kristen Sorth gave the following report.
		Library Update
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that the dashboard report for June contains a variety of statistical information for the Library.  She shared this with the Board.  This month the report includes information about circulation and visits.  It is important to note that even with five branches closed in April, circulation has only dropped 6% over May 2014.  This month, the report also includes programming statistics, telescope lending statistics, technology usage and an update on the Library’s social media.  The most popular items in the collection are also included. As of June 8th, 32,887 people have signed up for Summer Reading Club.
		·         The Library’s Free Lunch Program with Operation Food Search began on June 1st at Natural Bridge, Grand Glaize, Prairie Commons and Florissant Valley.  The program will be offered daily through August 7th.  Programming will be provided in addition to the free lunches and we plan to have a performer at each branch one day a week.  As of June 11th, 1177 lunches have been served at the four locations.  A reporter from ABC 30-KDNL visited both Operation Food Search and the Florissant Valley Branch and will be airing a story about the Free Lunch Program in the next week.  Operation Food Search will also provide free lunches at a designated Sweet Reads stop in Spanish Lake.
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that the Library received a $10,000 grant from the A.P. Green Foundation for the development of a children’s garden at Grant’s View.  The Boeing Employees Community Fund awarded the Library $5000 for the development of science kits that will be available for checkout at all branches and HQ.  The Youth Services Department will develop the kits which will include a science activity, a book and a DVD related to the particular science topic of the kit.
		·         The Library recently received an Overdrive Media Station. All hardware, set-up, and first year licenses will be at no cost to SLCL. The media station is currently being tested and will be made available to the public shortly. The media station is a showcase for our entire Overdrive catalog of ebooks, eaudio and evideo. Patrons will be able to browse titles in various categories, sample anything they are interested in and send a link via text or email for any titles they would like to download. May was the second highest month ever for eMedia topping 92,000 checkouts.  Library eMedia includes eBooks, eAudiobooks, eMagazines, eMusic and eVideos.
		·         In March, the Library Board approved a recommendation by the Administration to adopt a $25 minimum balance referral threshold on past due accounts submitted to Unique Management Services. Unique recommends a $25 minimum balance referral threshold since, in their experience, this ensures the best return of materials and the best opportunity for patrons to clear their accounts and return as library users in good standing.  Ms. Sorth said that we have heard from some concerned patrons and are currently documenting and tracking these concerns in writing.   We will continue to update the Board on this topic.
		·         Barbara Brain, Assistant Director of Adult and Support Services and Chris Pryor, Manager of Reference, visited Lambert – St. Louis International Airport and met with airport officials to discuss providing access to Library ebooks to passengers via a kiosk in the airport. Even passengers who are not library district residents could get a temporary library card to download a limited number of titles to their eReader.  Various locations for the kiosks were discussed as well as the process for approval by the airport.  If we proceed with this service, funds for the kiosk would be provided by the Library Foundation.
		·         In February, the Library Board approved entering into a contract with Market Volt for software and services that will enable the Library to reach out to customers about events and programs via e-mail. The first newsletter went out last week to approximately 150,000 patrons that have provided their email to the Library so they may keep up on current events at the Library.
		·         Ms. Sorth said that staff has started informing Webster Groves patrons about the upcoming changes due to the decision of the Webster Groves Public Library Board of Directors to cancel the reciprocal borrowing agreement with SLCL.  Bookmarks have been created, staff has been trained and information is available on our website.  Webster Groves residents with a current SLCL card can use their card through December 31, 2015. After that time, Webster Groves residents will be required to purchase a $50 non-resident card to borrow materials from St. Louis County Library. Individuals who live in Webster Groves and wish to apply for a new SLCL card after July 1, 2015 will need to purchase a $50 non-resident card to borrow materials.  Children enrolled in any school in St. Louis County will still be eligible for a free St. Louis County Library card. A library card is not required to attend programs, classes or to use public computers at St. Louis County Library.
		·         On May 27th, the Library was notified by the National Association of County Information Officers (NACIO) that the St. Louis County Library was receiving an Award of Excellence in the Public Education Campaign category for the Library’s Sweet Reads program. Each year, NACIO hosts its annual Awards of Excellence in Communications contest to recognize the best works of county public information officers and state association of counties communications staff. In addition to recognizing “Best of Class” and “Best of Show” winners, the competition honors a variety of communications projects that include public relations campaigns, brochures and publications, articles and press releases, videos and Internet/electronic innovations. Non-NACIO members may submit entries and we did so in April.
		·         Ms. Sorth announced that the Library has partnered with the AARP Speak Out volunteer speakers bureaus to offer presentations on a variety of topics over the summer months.  AARP trained volunteers and staff will present at multiple library locations on topics such as Fraud Watch and Aging Wisely (Brain Health) during the month of June.
		·         The Library will participate in Summer Learning Day on Friday, June 19 in support of the National Summer Learning Association's initiative to build awareness around summer learning loss and to promote activities which combat the problem.  At 9:30 a.m. on June 19, all of the open SLCL locations will read the same book to children.  The selected story, Chicken Big, is also one of the prize books that children may select upon completion of the Summer Reading Club.  Families will receive suggestions and a resource list of other learning activities to enjoy with their children during the summer months.
		·         As previously discussed, Ms. Sorth said the Library’s last community garden will be located at the new Grant’s View location.  Communications developed a flyer which directs interested gardeners to sign up at Tesson Ferry.
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that, due to multiple customer comments expressing concern regarding the decision to no longer have a paper listing of summer reading club programs, we have compiled a list of all summer reading club programs by branch and linked the document to the Library’s Events and Classes page on the website.  At their request, Library staff can print pages of this document for customers free of charge.  Next year, we will be printing a summer reading club program brochure.  We have also been collecting comments regarding the online summer reading club program and are making adjustments to the software.  There will be some other changes that we will implement for next year’s club.
		·         The design plans for the Natural Bridge Branch include an after-hours technology center.  Ms. Sorth and Jim Bogart met with Emerson to discuss the center and they agreed to fund the development of the center over the next three years.  We are currently administering a survey of Natural Bridge patrons to collect community input on the extended hours for the technology center.  Both an electronic and a paper version are available for the patrons.
		·         Voices of Glory, a finalist for America’s Got Talent, are three siblings who perform regularly in Branson, MO.  They will be the featured group at Florissant Valley Branch, Saturday, June 13th at 7 p.m. as part of Black Music Month which is sponsored by the Black History Celebration.  This event was rescheduled from February when bad weather necessitated the cancellation of the event.
		·         There were additional mentions of the St. Louis County Library in the media. Those articles were shared with the Board.
		·         Ms. Sorth showed a number of photographs to the Board from several programs and events including: STArt - I want to work at the Zoo at HQ, Benjie Molina at HQ, Free Lunch at Florissant Valley, 10th Anniversary of Suspense Night at HQ, Green Lantern Glow Party at Daniel Boone and Animal Tales at Daniel Boone.
		 Library Employee Update
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that the most recent estimates indicate that 91% of full time employees participated in the wellness screenings.  She said she was very pleased with this level of participation.
		·         All lines of the Library’s employee benefits renew on August 1.  The Board will review recommendations for health, life, vision and dental insurance later in the meeting.  Open enrollment will take place from June 29, 2015 – July 10, 2015.
		Library Facility Update
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that the Administration is discussing plans for opening the new and renovated branches as the Library moves closer to the completion of the first six construction projects.  There will likely be a 5-7 week process between the completion of the construction and the opening.  We are planning to have a soft opening followed by a celebratory grand opening several weeks later.
		·         The Library is in discussions with Metro about the possibility of adding bus service near the new Grant’s View Library.
		·         There is a parking lot light at the Florissant Valley Branch with a bad underground connection caused by corrosion. Building Systems staff is exploring options to fix the light which may include trenching or boring.  The lack of light on this area of the parking lot is a safety concern.
		·         There was a roof leak at the Sachs Branch during recent wet weather.  A rip was found around the front area of the roof drain and has been repaired.  We continue to have roof leaks at the Eureka Hills Branch.  This roof was replaced in 2014 and is under warranty.  The original roofing company has been contacted.
		·         Steve Hunter attended a new networking opportunity on June 9th.   PEOPLE, was created a little over a year ago as an organization dedicated to connecting MBE/WBE contractors with the mainstream industry.  There were at least 150 people in attendance which included owners, construction companies and contractors.
		Library Foundation
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that work at the Sachs Reading Garden is progressing.  The Foundation is actively fundraising for a shade structure to be installed in the garden.
		·         The Foundation is a sponsor of the Summer Reading Club again this year.  Their $10,000 sponsorship will be used to purchase billboards advertising the 2015 Summer Reading Club.  We have purchased four billboards which will be located along I-44, I-170, I-55 and Lindbergh Blvd. North of Page Ave.
		·         The Foundation delivered 540 backpacks filled with books and school supplies to the preschool and kindergarten students in the Normandy School District as part of a grant from the Greater St. Louis Book Fair.
		·         Planning for the Foundation’s annual gala is underway.  The gala will be held on September 19, 2015 and will be discussed later in the meeting.

		OLD BUSINESS
		NONE
		NEW BUSINESS
		Construction Update
		Steve Hunter presented a report on the branch transformation and new construction projects and shared photographs of the projects with the Board.
		Mr. Hunter said that he anticipated that the Jamestown Bluffs Branch building would be completed first and turned over to the library in late August. Furniture and shelving has been ordered for the four remodeling projects and two new buildings and weekly meetings are being held to plan for the branch reopenings. There has been no recurrence of the break-ins at Lewis & Clark.
		Dr. Beckwith thanked Mr. Hunter for his presentation and commented that the pictorial updates are much appreciated.
		Strategic Plan
		Marie Conlin gave an update on the 2015-2018 Strategic Plan that was approved by the Library Board in October 2014. Within the plan, goals and objectives are grouped into three major areas of focus: increasing literacy, strengthening the sense of community and creating gathering spaces.
		Ms. Conlin stated that 89 activities have been identified for 2015 in support of the Strategic Plan and she used the library’s web site to illustrate a number of the activities that are currently in process. Examples of the library’s literacy goals include increasing the availability of book clubs and financial programming for all ages, providing resources for new readers and increasing STEM related programming for children and teens. Much of the work in the portion of the plan pertaining to strengthening the sense of community involves partnerships with other organizations. Creating more dynamic children’s spaces, using architecture and design to make branches into destinations, and using the green space outside our branches to provide programming beyond the library proper were given as examples of the portion of the Strategic Plan dealing with creating gathering spaces.
		Dr. Beckwith thanked Ms. Conlin for her report.
		Vending Services
		Eric Button presented information to the Board on the company selected to provide vending services at each location in Phase 1 of the building program.
		Mr. Button stated that Headquarters is currently the only location offering vending machines. Frequent requests were received from patrons and staff to have vending at additional locations and this feedback was incorporated into planning and design of the Phase I building projects. Headquarters will have 2-3 public machines and 3-4 machines in the staff break room. All other locations will have 3 vending machines to provide snacks, beverages, and coffee.
		A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued on April 30, 2015 to identify a vendor to provide vending services for the eleven Phase I locations and Headquarters.  Several companies were notified including two from the Missouri Minority/Women Business Enterprise Program. Each respondent was asked to indicate the commission percentage the Library would receive from the gross sales of the machines. Three responses were received.
		The Administration selected Avendco LLC, which offers a 25% commission on gross sales, to provide vending services to the Library District for a three year term. Avendco is a Minority Business Enterprise. Vending will be added at each Phase I location when the building is open to the public. The terms of the RFP also make it possible for the service to expand beyond the initial twelve locations should the library wish to expand with Avendco. There is no cost to the library for this service. All machines, products and servicing will be provided by the selected vendor. Revenue generated through commissions will be directed to the library’s general operating fund.
		Self-Service Scanning and Faxing
		Eric Button presented the Administration’s recommendation for approval of a vendor to provide self-service scanning and faxing services for eleven Phase 1 building projects (Cliff Cave, Grant’s View, Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Lewis & Clark, Natural Bridge, Oak Bend, Prairie Commons, Rock Road, Samuel C. Sachs, and Weber Road branches) and Headquarters.
		An RFP was issued on April 23, 2015. An ad was placed in the Post-Dispatch and a notice was posted on the Library’s web page. Two responses were received. Each vendor presented base packages with several available options. Staff identified the desired options from the list and made as close a comparison as possible. One key difference was the availability of bill recyclers as an option from one vendor. This permits change to be made in bills rather than all coins.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to accept the lowest and best bid from TBS at a cost of $63,480 and the Board authorized the Library Director to enter into and execute a contract with TBS. As 11 of the 12 units to be purchased are part of the Phase 1 facility improvements, most of expenses will be paid using the bond proceeds. The twelfth unit (at HQ) will be paid from the Equipment budget. (Cunnane/Kenyon).
		Technology (Digital Signage)
		Gib Van Cleve presented the Administration’s recommendation for approval of the purchase of a digital signage solution for Headquarters and eleven Phase 1 building projects (Cliff Cave, Grant’s View, Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Lewis & Clark, Natural Bridge, Oak Bend, Prairie Commons, Rock Road, Samuel C. Sachs, and Weber Road branches).
		Mr. Van Cleve explained that all new and renovated branches will have a display monitor placed near the main entrance. A digital signage system will allow the Communications Department to centrally manage the digital content displayed on these monitors for the public to view. A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued on April 1st with responses due on the 28th. It was posted on our website and advertised in the St. Louis Post Dispatch. Four responses were received.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to accept the lowest and best proposal for the SM Infinity solution from Ziglin Signs at a cost of $20,688 for the first year and ongoing cloud services for $4,320 in subsequent years, and the Board authorized the Director to enter into and execute a contract to that effect. As this project is part of the Phase 1 facility improvements, these expenses will be paid using bond proceeds. The unit for Headquarters will be paid for out of the technology budget. (Sachs/Cunnane).
		Library Closures, September 19, 2015 and October 13, 2015
		Kristen Sorth requested the Board’s approval to close the Headquarters Branch at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 19, 2015 and also on Saturday, October 13, 2015.
		Ms. Sorth explained that the 6th Annual Foundation Gala will be held in the Headquarters Main Reading Room from 6:00-10:00 p.m. on September 19, 2015. Headquarters has closed at 1:00 p.m. in previous years in order to prepare for the Gala.
		 Ms. Sorth said that the Library has also been offered the opportunity to host popular children’s author Rick Riordan on October 13, 2015. This event will be held in the Headquarters Main Reading Room from 6:00-10:00 p.m. that day. Mr. Riordan traditionally draws 900-1000 attendees and a 1:00 p.m. closing is needed to prepare for the event.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s request to close Headquarters at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 19, 2015 to prepare for the 6th Annual Foundation Gala. The Library Board also approved the request to close the Headquarters Branch at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 13, 2015 in order to prepare for the Rick Riordan author event in the main Reading Room (Sachs/Tai).
		Employee Benefits- Health Insurance
		Mary Arnhart presented the Administration’s request, in consultation with Daniel and Henry, that the Library remain with Coventry as the Library’s employee health insurance provider.
		Ms. Arnhart explained that, per state statute, the Library is required to go out for bid for the Library’s employee health insurance policy every three years. Daniel and Henry sent out proposals to four health insurance companies and three self funded carriers. A spreadsheet comparing the three most competitive responses from Coventry, Anthem, and United Healthcare were shared with the Board. All three submitted bids that were lower than the Library’s current health insurance rates. Anthem was the lowest bid at half a percent lower than Coventry, the Library’s current carrier. The administrative costs of switching carriers are significant enough that the Administration recommends staying with our current carrier.
		Coventry’s proposal is a 9.16% decrease from our current costs. This percentage includes the required fee under the Affordable Care Act. With the Library Board’s approval, the employee rate would decrease effective August 1, 2015 from $619.09 to $562.41 a month and dependent coverage would decrease from $699.54 to $635.52 a month. Employees electing to have dependent coverage are responsible for its entire cost. This decrease would also affect the rates for the pre-65 insurance plan for retirees. The pre-65 insurance benefit is strictly voluntary and does not result in any cost to the Library.
		Ms. Arnhart said that employees who participated in the Wellness Screenings would continue to pay the preferred rate of $15 a month toward the cost of their individual health insurance. Employees who did not participate will pay $50 a month toward the cost of their health insurance. Preliminary reports reflect 91% of full-time Library employees participated in the Wellness Screenings. The Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) approved by the Library Board in 2008 will also remain in place. BeneFlex administers the Library’s HRA and Flexible Spending Account plan. There will be no additional administrative costs with the exception of a renewal fee for each plan of $200 each.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s request in consultation with Daniel and Henry that we remain with Coventry as the Library’s employee health insurance provider with a decrease of 9.16% from the Library’s current rates. Their renewal is significantly under budget as the budgeted amount for health insurance was an increase of 10% (Kenyon/Sachs).
		Employee Benefits- Dental Insurance
		Mary Arnhart presented the August 1, 2015 renewal for employee dental insurance from our current carrier, Delta Dental. Ms. Arnhart reported that there will be a 0% increase in employee and dependent rates. The employee rate paid by the Library will remain at $35.48 per month and the dependent rate remains at $62.82 per month. Employees electing to have dependent coverage are responsible for its cost.
		 The Library Board approved the Administration’s request in consultation with Daniel and Henry that we remain with Delta Dental. The budgeted amount for this increase was 5% (Kenyon/Sachs).
		Employee Benefits- Vision Insurance
		Ms. Arnhart presented the renewal costs for employee optional vision insurance which renews on August 1, 2015. A 5% renewal was received from VSP, the Library’s vision insurance provider. This benefit is voluntary and does not result in any cost to the Library. The employee rate will increase from $7.95/month to $8.35/month. Dependent coverage will increase from $17.10/month to $17.96/month.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation in consultation with Daniel and Henry that we remain with VSP for the Library’s optional vision insurance (Sachs/Kenyon).
		Employee Benefits-Life Insurance
		Ms. Arnhart also presented the Administration’s recommendation, in consultation with Daniel and Henry that the Library remain with its current carrier, Reliance Standard for life, AD&D, long-term disability, and voluntary life insurance.
		Ms. Arnhart explained that, per State statute, the Library is required to go out to the market for the Library’s employee insurance policies every three years. The August 1, 2015 insurance renewals include life, accidental death & dismemberment (AD&D), long-term disability (LTD), and voluntary life insurance. Four responses to the renewal were received with Reliance Standard submitting the lowest bid. The list of markets that were approached was shared with the Board. There will be a 15.92% increase for the Library’s basic life, AD&D, and LTD insurance through Reliance Standard. The rates for this coverage will increase from $.24/$.010/$1000 to $.32/$.010/$1000 for basic life/AD&D and decrease from $.22/$100 to $.20/$100 for LTD. The average yearly benefit the Library pays per fulltime employee is $264. There were no changes to the voluntary life insurance rates. Reliance Standard gave a 2-year rate hold.
		The Board approved the Administration’s recommendation, in consultation with Daniel and Henry that the Library remain with Reliance Standard for life, AD&D, long-term disability, and voluntary life insurance. The budgeted amount for this increase was 2% (Kenyon/Sachs).
		Performance Management Upgrade
		Mary Arnhart presented a recommendation to purchase Ceridian’s Dayforce performance management product.
		Ms. Arnhart reported that the Library currently uses an Excel based performance management system that was developed in-house in consultation with Lockton a number of years ago. At the October, 2014 Board Meeting, the Library Board approved Ceridian’s new Dayforce HR & Payroll system. The performance management system will be combined with the new Dayforce product. There will be one single source login to access all of the Ceridian products and the performance management product will be integrated with the other products. If approved, implementation of the new performance management system would begin in late 2015 and would be available for the 2016 performance evaluations.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for the purchase of the Dayforce performance management system for a one-time implementation fee of $3,500 with recurring fees of $19,740/annually and authorized the Director to enter into and execute this contract. This is below the budgeted amount of $75,000 that was included in the Library’s 2015 budget (Cunnane/Sachs).
		ADJOURN
		Mr. Sachs made a motion to adjourn the meeting.  Mrs. Kenyon seconded.  All approved with voice vote. Aye: Lynn Beckwith, Steve Sachs, Dr. Chingling Tai, Edith Cunnane, and Elena G Kenyon.
		The Library Board adjourned at 4:51 p.m.
