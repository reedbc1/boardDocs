		On November 21, 2013, the Fenton Board of Aldermen approved the Text Amendment to allow for public libraries in the R-1 zoning classification.  On December 3, 2013, the Fenton Planning and Zoning Commission made a recommendation to the Fenton Board of Aldermen to approve the Library’s Special Use Permit to operate a Public Library at the two properties we are under contract to purchase.  The Board of Aldermen will hold a public meeting on December 19, 2013 to consider the Planning and Zoning Commission’s recommendation.
		Tesson Ferry
		On November 26, 2013, the Library’s request to change the zoning on the property for the future site of Tesson Ferry was introduced at the St. Louis County Council Meeting.  Since that time, the request was read on December 3 and perfected on December 10.  The St. Louis County Council will review it for final approval on December 17, 2013.  We have been meeting with various St. Louis County officials to develop a plan regarding the traffic study.
		Library Update
		·         In January, the Youth Services Department will launch a brand new preschool art program where the focus is on the process of making art rather than the finished product.  Art activities will be open-ended and explorative in nature.  The program is based on the concept of open ended art.  Children can use their own imaginations to create something with the materials provided.  We may give the children paint, paper and brushes or other things like cotton balls and bubble wrap to paint with and they can create their own masterpiece.   This program is for children from 3-6 and is sure to be messy but fun.
		·         The Library will begin selling tumblers for $3.00.  These are left over prizes from the adult and teen reading clubs.
		·         The Library received a letter from North County Inc. in support of new construction for the Lewis and Clark Branch.
		·         The Library offers a free mobile “app” that patrons may download to their electronic devices such as a smart phone or a tablet.  The app has many features.  Patrons can search the catalog and check their library account to renew and request items, search and download eMedia titles from Overdrive, search for events and classes by location, by audience, by event type or see what is happening at SLCL today.  They can also ask a Librarian for help via phone, email or text, locate the closest St. Louis County Library branch, do research on-the-go with the mobile databases, and connect with SLCL through social media.  Ms. Sorth showed a demonstration for the Board of the app.
		·         The Library will be participating in Children’s Book Week again in 2014.  Children’s Book Week is May 12 - May 18.  Established in 1919, Children's Book Week is the longest-running national literacy initiative in the country.  Every year, commemorative events are held nationwide at schools, libraries, bookstores etc.  Children's Book Week is administered by Every Child A Reader, a 501(c)(3) literacy organization dedicated to instilling a lifelong love of reading in children. The Children's Book Council, the national non-profit trade association for children's book publishers, is an anchor sponsor.  The Library will have programs and authors during that week.
		·         The Library has many creative employees and their creativity can be seen in the displays at the branches and HQ.  We have compiled several pictures to show the Library Board.
		·         Over 30 kids and teens participated in the Mid-County Youth Chess Tournament on December 7. The event ran nearly 3 hours, with several tense tie-breakers at the end.  The branch plans on hosting another chess tournament next year.
		·         As of last week, the St. Louis County Library circulation for 2013 surpassed the total circulation for 2012.  Ms. Sorth said we still have a few weeks left in 2013 and are hoping to hit 15 million circulations in 2013.  Also, the Library held 1410 programming sessions just in the month of November, hosting 18,206 attendees. Ms. Sorth has been working with Stephanie Nordmann, Gib Van Cleve and Marie Conlin to develop a report that she will give to the Board monthly with various statistics.  The Library Board will receive this first “dashboard” report at the January Board Meeting.
		·         Ms. Sorth gave the Library Board an update on the very popular beach balls from Summer Reading Club.  They are still making an appearance.
		·        Ms. Sorth attended the December Foundation Board Meeting and also participated in two of their committee meetings:  The Programming Committee and the Sachs Reading Garden Committee.
		·         Ms. Sorth thanked the Library Board for their dedication and support of the St. Louis County Library. She said the staff is truly thankful for their leadership.
		Library Employee Update
		·         The Library’s auditors Kerber Eck and Braeckel were at the Library last week conducting their preliminary field work for the Library’s audit.  They will return in January.
		·         The Library’s Experience Mod rating for Worker’s Compensation has been received.  It is a .98.  This number represents either a credit or debit that is applied to the Library's workers’ compensation premium.  A rating of 1.0 is considered to be the industry average.  An Experience Mod under 1.0 is a Credit Mod, which means losses are better than expected, resulting in a premium discount.  The Library has a Safety Committee which reviews all accidents and incidents.
		·         The Branch Managers and Assistant Branch Managers are actively involved in community organizations such as Rotary, Kiwanis or the local Chamber of Commerce in their service area.   These relationships lead to other outreach, program opportunities and community relationships.
		·         Barbara Turkington, Assistant Director of Advancement, was honored by Racial Harmony as a 2013 Phenomenal Woman of Metropolitan St. Louis.  Racial Harmony is a non-profit organization whose mission is to promote understanding, cooperation and communication among all races and ethnic groups.
		·         Gina Sheridan, Assistant Branch Manager at Mid County, has been collecting funny/heartwarming stories from library workers around the country on her blog I work at a public library for a few years.   She has recently received an offer for a book deal and has signed with Adams Media.  The book is to be released in Spring 2014.
		Library Facility Update
		·         The new HVAC controls at Jamestown Bluffs are complete.
		·         The new self check stations for Sachs have been installed.
