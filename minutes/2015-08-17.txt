	TAX HEARING
	Ms. Sorth explained that Missouri State Statute requires that a public hearing be held prior to the Library Board setting the 2015 tax rates. The four subclasses of property are residential, agricultural, commercial, and personal property.  As in prior years, the required legal notice must be published at least 7 days prior to the date of the hearing.  The notice appeared in the St. Louis Post Dispatch and was posted in all branches and headquarters on Wednesday, August 5, 2015.
	The setting of the 2015 tax rates will take place at the September Library Board meeting.  Updated post Board of Equalization assessments for 2015 will be used to set the tax rates and will be available in September.  Tax rates must be set prior to October 1, 2015.
	Dr. Beckwith asked if there were any patrons wanting to address the Board regarding the tax rate. No one came forward to address the Board and Dr. Beckwith reconvened the regularly scheduled Board meeting.
	THE REGULAR BOARD MEETING RESUMED
	MINUTES
	The Library Board approved the minutes from the July 20, 2015 meeting (Tai/Kenyon).
	PUBLIC COMMENT
	There were no public comments.
	TREASURER’S REPORT
	Kristen Sorth reported that the Library District received $24,221 from the Webster Groves Public Library related to our reciprocal borrowing agreements with area municipal libraries. Valley Park is the only Municipal Library with a balance to pay.
	The Library District received an E-Rate rebate for the 2013/2014 year in the amount of $69,447. This rebate applies to the Library District’s VOIP services and was delayed until the Library District provided more information to the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), the governing body of the E-Rate program. USAC routinely and randomly pulls rebate applications for further review.
	The Library made its second and final payment of $25,820 to H&H Health Associates for the Wellness Program. The payment was for optional health screenings available to full time employees. Total costs for health screenings in 2015 was $47,200. These costs were included in the 2015 budget.
	The Library District incurred $35,888 of expense for the 2015 Summer Reading Club. The costs were largely for various branch programs.
	Capital Projects Fund Balance Sheet
	Total Construction in Progress for July 2015 was $3,786,886. The expenses included payments for:
	·         Grants View construction (payable to many sub-contractors) - $2,082,229
	·         Lewis and Clark construction (payable to many sub-contractors) – $665,261
	·         Architect’s fees payable to Bond for the renovations - $811,985
	·         Professional services of the Construction Manager - $304,554
	·         Architect’s fees payable to KAI and Christner – $41,237
	The remaining dollars were largely spent for the services of the Facilities Master Plan Administrator, storage expenses, and environmental professional services.
	The Library Board approved the Treasurer's Report subject to audit (Cunnane/Tai).
	DIRECTOR’S REPORT
	Kristen Sorth gave the following report.
	Library Update
	·         Ms. Sorth reported that the dashboard report for August contains a variety of statistical information for the Library. The report was shared with the Board. This month the report includes information about circulation and visits. With five branches closed, circulation dropped 8.6% over July, 2014. The library had several notable increases in July including program attendance which increased 17% over July, 2014 and eMedia circulation which exceeded 100,000 items. This is the highest monthly eMedia circulation on record. The most popular items in the collection are also included.
	·         The Greater St. Louis Humanities Festival is an annual, weeklong series of public forums, film screenings, lectures, and other programs featuring the humanities. The theme for 2015 is Community Viability and Vitality. St. Louis County Library is partnering with UMSL – Center for the Humanities on the opening event of the Festival. On Monday, September 28 at 12 p.m. at the Florissant Valley Branch, Michael Castro, St. Louis’s first Poet Laureate will read from his work, with music from cellist Tracy Andreotti and percussionist Henry Claude. Our second Festival event is St. Louis Immigration Stories, October 1 at 7:00 p.m. at Headquarters. Authors of the new book, Ethnic St. Louis, will join with a panel of first and second generation immigrants to present stories of the significant impact of St. Louis’ immigrant communities both past and present. This event is presented in partnership with the Missouri Immigrant and Refugee Advocates, the St. Louis MOSAIC Project, the International Institute, and St. Louis County Parks and Recreation.
	·         This summer, the Library plans to purchase the Self-e and BiblioBoard Creator platforms. Self-e was developed by Library Journal and BiblioBoard to enable public libraries to easily accept self-published books from local authors in electronic format and make those eBooks available to patrons. BiblioBoard Creator is a similar platform we plan to use to create a collection of local music in electronic format.
	·         Ms. Sorth reported that the History & Genealogy Department purchased the private collection of the late Joy Reisinger. Ms. Reisinger was a well known Certified Genealogist Emeritus and lecturer. Her collection consists of 1450 books that will add significant depth to our holdings of French Canadian materials and provide sources for other parts of Canada and the United States. The collection will be named after Ms. Reisinger.
	·         Planning is underway for the one year birthday parties for Born to Read families. Initially, four parties will be scheduled per quarter. One each at Daniel Boone, Florissant Valley, Grant’s View and HQ. The first party will be scheduled at HQ. Parties will be presented jointly by the Youth Services staff and branch staff. They will feature stories, cupcakes for the 1-year-olds, refreshments, distribution of another free book and early literacy information. We will continue to plan for an expansion of Born to Read at additional hospitals in anticipation of increased funding from the Foundation.
	·         The Summer Reading Club ended on August 8. We had 59,733 registrations and 26,607 completions. The Daniel Boone Branch had the most registrations this year. This was the first year the clubs went online and this did change the dynamic. Ms. Sorth said that we have listened to both the positive and negative feedback received and will be making some changes for next year. Some of those changes involve modifications to the software. We will produce printed copies of the program guide instead of just offering it online and will encourage staff to tell patrons that paper reading logs are still available. Branch and Youth Services staff will be discussing other possible changes in the next several months.
	·         St. Louis County Library hosted a table at the Redbird Rookies Health Fair at UMSL on Saturday, July 18. Library staff promoted the services and programs to 1,370 kids and their families.
	·         Ms. Sorth was asked to serve on a community advisory board related to a grant proposal that is being submitted by the St. Louis University Medical Center Library. The grant to the National Institute for Minority and Health Disparities specifically addresses breast cancer mortality rates in African American women resulting from barriers to accessing health information. The research team believes that public libraries play an important role in providing online health information to the public, which is why Ms. Sorth was asked to serve on the advisory board and the community coalition.
	·         Ms. Sorth, the Manager of Reference, the Electronic Resources Coordinator and Barbara Brain visited Lambert St. Louis International Airport to look at possible locations for an Overdrive airport media station in both Terminal 1 and 2. The stations provide Library eBook access to passengers via a kiosk in the airport. Even passengers who are not library district residents could get a temporary library card to download a limited number of titles to their eReader. The group met with the Airport Properties Division Manager and identified several possible locations. They have received an agreement from the Airport and will be reviewing it with legal counsel. Ms. Sorth said that if we proceed with this service, funds for the kiosk would be provided by the Library Foundation.
	·         The Free Lunch program ended on Friday, August 7. The Library served 6,006 free meals to children this summer at four branches – Florissant Valley, Grand Glaize, Natural Bridge and Prairie Commons.  There were concerns with the vendor selected by Operation Food Search (OFS). Administration has shared those concerns with OFS and it will be part of the discussion for the program in 2016.
	·         Ms. Sorth mentioned in May that the Library was subscribing to Lynda.com which offers many online educational courses for our patrons that are accessible with a St. Louis County Library card. Lynda.com is an award-winning provider of educational materials with an ever-expanding library of thousands of rich online tutorials in a variety of topic areas. Videos for all skill levels are offered and can be viewed a few minutes at a time or longer. Lynda.com went live on August 1. As of August 12, more than 1,200 people have signed up and over 5000 videos have been viewed. We have received a tremendous amount of positive comments about the service on both social media and through patron emails to the webmaster.
	·         Plans are well underway for the closure of the next five branches. As a result, programs will not be scheduled and meeting rooms will not be available starting on October 31 at the Sachs Branch and on November 30 at Cliff Cave, Natural Bridge, Oak Bend and Prairie Commons.
	·         There were additional mentions of the St. Louis County Library in the local media. Those articles were shared with the Board.
	·         Ms. Sorth also shared a number of photos with the Board from several programs and events including: Firefighters at HQ, Superhero lap time at HQ, Sara Paretsky teen writing workshop and author event, SLCL at the Muny, Sandy Williams’s author event at Florissant Valley and Discovery Club at Grand Glaize.
	Library Employee Update
	·         Ms. Sorth reported that the ALA-Black Caucus held its conference in St. Louis during the first week of August. There were approximately 200 registered attendees. Many of the Library’s employees were involved in planning the event and also attended. The Library had an exhibitor's booth at the conference where we displayed and provided information about SLCL and spoke to attendees about employment opportunities at the Library.
	·         Ms. Sorth said that flu shots will be available for Library staff at four branches in October.
	·         The Administration received five applications for the Donell J. Gaertner Scholarship. The $5000 scholarship toward a Master’s Degree in Library Science was developed several years ago with funds donated by previous St. Louis County Library Director, Don Gaertner. Jennifer Ilardi, the Youth Services Specialist at Florissant Valley, was selected to receive this year’s scholarship.
	·         A copy of the 2015 Library Holiday Schedule was shared with the Board.
	Library Facility Update
	·         Ms. Sorth reported that Daniel Boone, Grand Glaize and Tesson Ferry have all experienced power outages in the last several weeks.
	·         The employees from Building Systems have started visiting the Lewis & Clark and Jamestown Bluffs Branches to begin planning for maintenance of the new and renovated facilities.
	·         There have been several issues with the generator at Daniel Boone. Buildings Systems is investigating.
	·         There was a roof leak at Bridgeton Trails in the staff room. The roofing company has been notified.
	Library Foundation
	·         Ms. Sorth said that work at the Sachs Reading Garden is progressing but was hampered by the very rainy weather. 34 days of construction were lost due to the weather. The Reading Garden will be discussed later in this meeting.
	·         Orientation for new Foundation Board Members will be held at the end of August.
	·         Ms. Sorth said that the Gala, which will take place on September 19, has the largest number of sponsors and attendees in the history of the event.

	CONSTRUCTION UPDATE

	The library received 32 responses to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for Phase 2 architects and responses to the Phase 2 Construction Manager Request for Proposal (RFP) were due August 28. The Administration’s architect and construction manager selections will be presented to the Board at the September meeting.
	Ms. Sorth showed photographs of the Grant’s View, Lewis & Clark, Rock Road, Indian Trails, and Jamestown Bluffs projects and reported that Lewis & Clark is complete except for the parking lot.
	Planning is ongoing for the re-opening process and involves almost every department. In response to questions from the Board regarding opening celebrations, Ms. Sorth said that we are planning soft openings initially followed by grand openings a short time later.
	BRANCH SERVICE AREAS
	Eric Button gave a PowerPoint presentation on branch service areas. He stated that Community profiles for each location were created in 2009 and updated in 2012.  These profiles help inform decisions regarding collection and facility needs as well as programming and outreach efforts.
	Improved awareness of community needs and the strengthening of community relationships
	are among the benefits of having assigned service areas. Mr. Button explained that some of the considerations for service area boundaries included travel routes and access to a branch from residential neighborhoods as well as the distance from a branch to key organizations and schools within the service area. In order to allow Branch Managers to quickly identify businesses, schools, and other organizations within their service area, maps were scanned in at a high resolution so that staff is able to zoom to street name level.
	With the opening of Grant’s View this year, service area boundaries in South County needed to be changed. New service area maps were created that went into effect August 1 for Grant’s View, Cliff Cave, Oak Bend and Weber Road.
	Dr. Beckwith thanked Mr. Button for his informative presentation.
	NETWORK EQUIPMENT UPGRADES
	Gib Van Cleve presented a recommendation to purchase networking equipment for Headquarters and the first six Phase 1 building projects. Mr. Van Cleve reported that the networking equipment at Headquarters and the branches needs to be upgraded since the existing Cisco networking equipment is over five years old and is no longer supported by Cisco.
	Working with the local Cisco Systems representative and local reseller Alexander Open Systems (AOS), Western States Contracting Alliance (WSCA) pricing quotations were obtained for the desired equipment. Mr. Van Cleve explained that the new equipment falls into two categories. Equipment for Headquarters and Daniel Boone will control network traffic flow across the district while equipment for the branches will provide connectivity to PCs.
	The Library Board approved Administration’s recommendation for the purchase of networking equipment for Headquarters, Daniel Boone, Lewis & Clark, Grant’s View, Weber Road, Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs and Rock Road from AOS via the WSCA cooperative purchasing agreement. The cost for Headquarters and Daniel Boone which comes from the 2015 Technology Budget is $56,062. The cost for Lewis and Clark, Grant’s View, Weber Road, Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs and Rock Road which will be paid for with bond proceeds, is $67,740. The total purchase is $123,802. The Board also authorized the Director to enter into and execute a contract to that effect (Cunnane/Kenyon).
	DISPLAY OF COMMUNITY INFORMATION POLICY
	Barbara Brain presented a recommendation for approval of the revised Display of Community Information Policy to replace the existing Handouts Policy that was last approved on June 15, 2009.
	Ms. Brain explained that the Display of Community Information Policy provides information on the type of printed material the Library will accept for posting or display. It makes clear that the Library designates space at each branch for the temporary posting or display of print materials pertaining to tax-supported or not-for-profit organizations. It also emphasizes that Library space may not be used for “commercial purposes; partisan political purposes; to advocate or solicit support for one candidate or cause; or to present material that violates the law or is obscene”. A statement has been added to clarify that acceptance or rejection of material for display does not imply the Library’s approval or disapproval of the ideas or opinions expressed. The policy also states that the “Library does not assume responsibility or liability for materials posted or displayed in Library facilities”. The revised Display of Community Information Policy has been reviewed by legal counsel. Copies of the existing and revised policy statements were shared with the Board.
	The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for approval of the revised Display of Community Information Policy (Kenyon/Tai).
	LIBRARY BOARD ORGANIZATION
	Kristen Sorth stated that, according to the Library Board’s By-Laws, officers of the Board need to be elected at the August meeting to serve for the next twelve months.

Due to the extensive number of rain day delays (34), it is necessary to request an extension to the completion date. The Third Amendment drafted by Lashly & Baer and the revised Development Agreement were shared with the Board.
