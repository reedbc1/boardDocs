	TREASURER'S REPORT
	Kris Mooney reported that the Library District received $25,000 in April from St. Louis County’s distribution of the Athletes and Entertainers Tax. This was the second of two payments for the 2015 fiscal year bringing the total A&E tax revenue to $50,000. This item was budgeted at $25,000.
	In April, the Library District also received the entire State Aid payment of $429,574 for fiscal year 2015 from the Missouri State Library.
	The Library has entered into a three year contract with MarketVolt LLC for software and services that will enable the District to reach out to customers about events and programs via e-mail. MarketVolt’s bid of $15,600 annually for the service was approved by the Board at the February 9, 2015 meeting. Services are expected to begin in June.
	The Library District spent $115,471 for books to be used as prizes for baby, kids, and teen Summer Reading Clubs.
	The Library incurred $42,929 in expenses for snow and ice removal from February to early March
	The annual Pharos software-license renewal and the Tracsystems hardware maintenance agreement fees were paid in April at a total cost of $18,058.
	Capital Projects Fund Balance Sheet
	Total Construction in Progress for April 2015 was $2,358,122. The expenses included payments for:
	·         Lewis and Clark construction in February and March (payable to many subcontractors) – $1,323,938

	·         The remaining dollars were largely spent for the services of the Facilities Master Plan Administrator, storage expenses, and environmental professional services.
	The Library Board approved of the Treasurer's Report subject to audit (Kenyon/Cunnane).
	DIRECTOR'S REPORT
	Kristen Sorth gave the following report.
	Ms. Sorth began by announcing that Dr. Beckwith had taught his last class at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and would officially retire September 1, 2015.
	Library Update
	·         Ms. Sorth reported that the dashboard report for May contains a variety of statistical information for the Library.  She shared copies of this report with the Board.  This month the report includes information about circulation and visits.  Ms. Sorth noted that, even with five branches closed in April, circulation has only dropped 5% over April 2014.  Bridgeton Trails, Florissant Valley, Tesson Ferry and Natural Bridge all saw dramatic increases in both circulation and visits.  Bridgeton Trails was again the most dramatic with a 130% increase in visits and a 55% increase in circulation. The Library has already installed 10 additional Internet PCs at Bridgeton Trails and will be adding one additional circulation PC to help with the increase.  This month the report also includes a peer comparison to other Missouri libraries.  The most popular items in the collection are also included.
	·         Ms. Sorth announced that the Food for Fines program was successful again this year with 35,431 pounds of food collected system-wide.  The program is one of Operation Food Search’s largest food drives. This was our largest collection in the seven years the Library has offered Food for Fines.  Florissant Valley, Tesson Ferry and Natural Bridge were the top branches.
	·         Ms. Sorth asked for Scott Holl, Manager of History and Genealogy to stand and announced that he had received the William Filby Award for Genealogical Librarianship at the National Genealogical Society conference in St. Charles.  The Filby Award is a prestigious honor in genealogical circles that is given to a person who has made significant contributions to the field of genealogy or local history. Scott was nominated by members of the St. Louis Genealogical Society for his work at St. Louis County Library.  Ms. Sorth said that the Library is very proud of Scott!
	·         Last week, the History & Genealogy Department hosted attendees of the National Genealogical Society (NGS) Conference that was held at the St. Charles Convention Center. Scott Holl, Jake Eubanks and the entire staff did a great job accommodating the genealogists who visited the department in order to take advantage of unique research materials in our collection.  By mid week, almost 300 conference attendees had visited the department.  The Library received lots of positive feedback about how helpful and knowledgeable History & Genealogy staff has been.
	·         The Library will be subscribing to the Lynda Library product this year.  Lynda Library offers many online educational courses for our patrons that are accessible with a St. Louis County Library card.  Lynda Library is an award-winning provider of rich, relevant and educational materials with an ever-expanding library of thousands of rich online tutorials in a variety of topic areas.  Videos for all skill levels are offered and can be viewed a few minutes at a time or longer. Those who finish a training series will receive a custom-made certificate of completion.
	·         In March, the Library Board approved naming a room or space in a North County renovated Library branch after Beau Willimon, the creator, head writer and producer of the award winning Netflix series, House of Cards.  Beau was the featured guest on March 7 at a Library Foundation fundraising reception where more than $36,000 was raised for the Foundation’s ForWord Fund.  Ms. Sorth said the Administration is recommending the Library name the Natural Bridge meeting room after Beau Willimon.  The Natural Bridge Branch will be closed for construction beginning in the fall.
	·         The Webster Groves Public Library Board of Directors has recently been discussing reciprocity with SLCL as part of their strategic planning efforts.  Ms. Sorth was notified via letter in March that the Policy Committee of the Webster Groves Library Board was recommending to the larger Board at their March meeting that they withdraw from the agreement with SLCL.  Ms. Sorth said that she wrote back to Webster Groves expressing her disappointment at the recommendation and asking them to delay a decision until the newly approved reciprocal contract terms could be evaluated.  The Library Board had voted in June, 2014 to amend the reciprocal contract by waiving the transaction fee for renewals at the request of the Municipal Libraries.  The Municipal Library Boards did not approve this change until the end of December and as a result the change just went into effect on January 1, 2015.  Unfortunately, the Webster Groves Public Library Board of Trustees voted to terminate the reciprocal agreement with St. Louis County Library effective June 30, 2015.  As a result, Webster Groves residents will have to purchase a $50 non-resident card in order to check out materials or use electronic resources from the St. Louis County Library.  This will begin on July 1 and non-resident cards must be purchased annually for continued service at SLCL.  It is important to note that all children in St. Louis County, regardless of where they live, are eligible for a free SLCL Library Card.  The Library Administration is developing information for patrons to explain the upcoming change.
	·         The Library’s Free Lunch Program with Operation Food Search begins on June 1st at Natural Bridge, Grand Glaize, Prairie Commons and Florissant Valley.  The program will be offered daily through August 7th.  Programming will be provided in addition to the free lunches and we plan to have a performer at each branch one day a week.
	·         In February, Ms. Sorth was contacted by the Urban Libraries Council (ULC) and the Institute for Museum and Library Science (IMLS) about a new initiative for getting library cards in the hands of every child.  Ms. Sorth was invited to participate in a discussion with a small number of library leaders from across the country.  Last month, the White House contacted Ms. Sorth with information on a conference call that would take place to discuss the initiative.  The President announced the National ConnectED Library Challenge on April 30th.  St. Louis County Library is honored to be one of 30 library districts to be selected to participate.  The project’s goal is to make sure every child enrolled in school receives a library card.  The library is partnering with the Parkway School District and the Jennings School District on this program.  County Executive Steve Stenger endorsed the initiative.  Starting in the fall of 2015, all students in grades K-12 in the Jennings and Parkway School Districts will automatically be issued a library card, unless their parents opt out of the process. SLCL expects over 19,000 students in these districts to have library cards by the end of the year.  Communities adopting the ConnectED Library Challenge include: Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cleveland, Clinton Macomb, Columbus, Cuyahoga County, D.C., Denver, Hartford, Hennepin County, Howard County, Indianapolis, Madison, Milwaukee, New Haven, Oakland, Pierce County, Pima, Pocatello, Pueblo City, Ramsey County, Columbia, Rochester Hills, Rochester, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Seattle, Skokie, and St. Louis.
	·         There were additional mentions of the St. Louis County Library in the media.  Ms. Sorth shared copies of the articles with the Board.   She also shared a number of photos from several programs and events including: Reading Garden Groundbreaking at Sachs, Eric Greitens at HQ, the Storage Facility, the Dance Party and Luau at HQ, Pete the Cat Visits Prairie Commons, Star Wars Fan Fest at Tesson Ferry and the NGS Filby Award.
	Library Employee Update
	·         MoDot has approved the Library’s application to adopt a half mile section of Lindbergh outside HQ for trash pickup. Once the Adopt-A-Highway signs are installed, Barbara Brain and the Green Team will begin cleanups.
	·         With branches closed for construction and staff stationed at other branches, the Staff Trainers are currently providing training for staff on Customer Service, CPR, Google Drive, Google Calendar, and other topics.
	·         It’s been ten years since we last asked Lockton, the Library’s HR consultant, to review the Library’s pay structure.  This review will take place over the summer and involves the slotting of selected titles and pay grades in to appropriate pay ranges based on Lockton’s review of other peer libraries and public entities.  Ms. Sorth stated that the Board would be kept informed on this process.
	Library Facility Update
	·         Steve Hunter and Ms. Sorth met with Colliers to begin discussions about Phase 2 of the facilities plan which includes the purchase of land for a new Meramec Valley as well as the purchase of land for the operation center.  The Mid-County Branch was also discussed.  This summer, the Library will be requesting proposals for a construction manager and an architect for Phase 2 of the facilities plan.  Once an architect is selected, their first task will be to conduct a site evaluation and test fit of the current location of Mid-County.  Phase 2 involves construction projects at Bridgeton Trails, Daniel Boone, Florissant Valley, Grand Glaize, Meramec Valley, Mid-County and Thornhill.
	·         The St. Louis County Department of Transportation called to discuss the plans for Musick Road which is located by the new Grant’s View Branch.  The plans to lower the incline of the road and widen the road are progressing.
	·         Branch staff are working in the storage facility on collection maintenance which includes pulling items from the warehouse collections that have holds, locating and examining the last copies in the warehouse, and un-boxing CDs.  Staff is also conducting a collection inventory of the materials stored in the warehouse from the five locations that are currently closed.  They are making use of laptops and barcode scanners to scan in each item.  The resulting reports will be processed by System Administration to clean up the Library’s database of materials.
	·         Florissant Valley Branch will celebrate its 50th anniversary in June.  Several activities and programs are being planned from June 4-6, including the Cannon Brothers, Babaloo, balloon animals, and other activities.
	·         The repair work on the plaza at Mid-County is now complete.  Once the handrails are installed, the steps will be open to the public.
	·         The sewer line and the pump station at Prairie Commons were inspected by a plumbing company.  The branch has been experiencing issues with the restrooms.   Administration is waiting on the results of the inspection.
	Library Foundation
	·         Ms. Sorth also reported that the groundbreaking ceremony for the Sachs Reading Garden took place on April 21, 2015 at 2:00 p.m.  Many Foundation Board Members were in attendance.  Library Board Member Steve Sachs along with the two other major donors Susan Nagarkatti and Deborah Patterson, President of the Monsanto Fund, were also in attendance.  Site work has started at the garden.
	·         The Foundation is a sponsor of the Summer Reading Club again this year.  Their $10,000 sponsorship will be used to purchase billboards advertising the 2015 Summer Reading Club.
	·         The Foundation participated in Give STL Day.  94 donors gave $8550 to the St. Louis County Library Foundation.
	·         The Foundation’s annual partnership appreciation breakfast is June 11 at 7:30 a.m.

	Summer Reading Club Presentation
	Nicole Clawson,Youth Services Manager, gave a Powerpoint  presentation this year’s Summer Reading Club (SRC).
	Ms. Clawson stated that the Library Board had approved a hosting service for an online SRC in September 2014. She explained that the new online platform allows us to enhance the summer reading program by creating an overall learning experience by focusing on personal achievement through a system of awarding virtual “badges”. The SRC is broken down into four age groups, Early Readers, Kids, Teens and Adults. Registration began on May 1, officially launched today and will run through August 1.
	Ms. Clawson explained the process for registering for the SRC and showed an example of an account where the number of minutes or titles read can be entered. She said that more than 9,000 patrons had signed up on the first day. Programs will be offered at all open branches for all ages again this summer and community experiences are an exciting new addition to the SRC this year. The library has partnered with local organizations such as the Zoo, Magic House, and Botanical Garden where SRC participants can complete a designated activity and earn a secret code. That secret code can then be entered into the participant’s online account to earn points toward the completion goal.
	Ms. Clawson said that those who would like to participate but have no computer access at home can track their reading on their own and then visit the library where staff and/or volunteers will be on hand to help them register, record their reading and claim prizes all in one visit.
	Construction Update
	Steve Hunter reported on the branch renovation and new construction projects. Mr. Hunter shared photos of the projects with the Board.
	Mr. Hunter stated that the stained glass windows were safely removed from the old Lewis and Clark Branch and that demolition work on the building continues. He also reported that the security has been arranged at the new building during non-working hours since the site has been broken into on two occasions.
	Mr. Hunter said that design development is underway for the next five branches to be renovated.
	Signage Fabrication and Installation
	Eric Button presented a recommendation to select ASI as the lowest and best bid for signage fabrication and installation services for eleven (11) Phase 1 building projects (Cliff Cave, Grant’s View, Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Lewis & Clark, Natural Bridge, Oak Bend, Prairie Commons, Rock Road, Samuel C. Sachs, and Weber Road branches).
	 In July 2014, the Board had approved the selection of Christner Inc. to provide physical way finding solution services to assist library staff in the development of a comprehensive and consistent signage package to be implemented as library building projects are completed. A signage package was developed and an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for Signage Fabrication and Installation was issued on April 21, 2015. Architectural designs for five of the eleven locations included in the scope of the IFB were not available when the IFB was issued. As a result, the quantities of signs may change slightly for Cliff Cave, Natural Bridge, Oak Bend, Prairie Commons, and Samuel C. Sachs. Sign types and quantities for these locations were based on the best estimates of library staff and Christner Inc.
	Six vendors, including three from the Missouri Minority/Women Business Enterprise Program, were notified of the bid, the IFB was placed on the Library’s web page, and an ad was placed in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Four responses were received.
	The Library Board approved the lowest and best bid from ASI at a cost of $265,434.88 authorized the Library Director to enter into and execute a contract with ASI (Sachs/Cunnane).  As this project is part of the Phase 1 facility improvements, these expenses will be paid using the bond proceeds.
	Exhibits/Display Policy
	Barbara Brain presented the administration’s recommendation for approval of a revised Exhibits/Display Policy.
	Ms. Brain stated that the existing Exhibits Policy was approved by the Library Board on May 17, 1999 and has been substantially revised with input from legal counsel. The revised policy expands on the criteria for selection of items that individuals and groups may display in the library and provides regulations for the set-up and take-down of displays. It also makes a distinction between items arranged in the locked display cases and exhibits of local artwork or traveling exhibits that may be displayed within the library reading rooms. The policy states that the library accepts displays and exhibits of an educational, cultural, civic, charitable or recreational purpose based on a number of factors including the suitability of the presentation for the intended audience, the interest of the community and availability of space. It makes clear that library space may not be used for commercial or partisan political purposes nor to advocate or solicit support for a candidate or cause. The existing and revised policy statements were provided to the Board for comparison purposes.
	The Library Board approved the revised Exhibits/Display Policy (Cunnane/Kenyon).
	Accessibility Policy
	Barbara Brain presented the administration’s recommendation for approval of a revised Accessibility policy.
	Ms. Brain explained that the Accessibility Policy lists the physical accommodations and services the library offers to individuals with disabilities. Several minor changes have been made to the policy to remove dated language and to add information on the library’s electronic services. Specific examples of the changes include removal of the mention of public telephones from the list of physical accommodations, the removal of references to Braille books and audio books and the addition of emedia to the Library Materials of Interest section. All changes were reviewed by legal counsel. The policy statement with changes tracked was shared with the Board.
	The Library Board approved the revised Accessibility Policy (Kenyon/Cunnane).
	Employee Health Insurance Contribution
	Mary Arnhart presented the administration’s recommendation to increase the health insurance contribution for those employees who do not participate in the Library’s Wellness Program.
	Ms. Arnhart reported that the Library Board had approved a Wellness Program for Library employees in May 2014. Also, in June of last year, Ms. Sorth presented a report on the Employee Health Insurance Contribution and recommended differentiating the contribution for employees based on their participation in the Wellness Program. This recommendation was also included in the 2015 Library Budget. The April Director’s report stated that Library employees will be participating in Wellness Screenings beginning in late May and continuing to the middle of June. Employees have already been notified that they will likely pay a higher amount towards the cost of their insurance if they don’t participate in the Wellness Screenings. Employees that do participate will continue to pay $15.00/month towards the cost of their health insurance. The Library’s health insurance plan renews on August 1, 2015 and the Library Board will be reviewing the renewals at the June Board Meeting.
	The Library Board approved the administration’s recommendation that employees who do not participate in the Library’s Wellness Program pay $50.00/month towards the cost of their health insurance. This would be effective August 1, 2015, in conjunction with the Insurance Open Enrollment period (Cunnane/Sachs).
	Furniture and Shelving Selection
	Steve Hunter presented the administration’s recommendation to approve the lowest and best bid(s) for the combined Furniture and Shelving bid packages for Grant’s View, Lewis & Clark, Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Weber Road, and Rock Road.
	Mr. Hunter explained that these bid packages were initially presented to the Board on April 20, 2015 and two agreements totaling $1,667,108.25 were approved. However, during the preparation of the contract documents, it was discovered that one of the bidders made a post-bid error not in their overall base price, but by overstating the breakout cost for an alternate. The company, CI Select, was not awarded that particular alternate but, since its cost was subtracted from their overall price in our analysis, the value of their base bid was understated by $105,902.69. Mr. Hunter stated that the issue was discussed at length with legal counsel and it was determined that the Board would need to re-approve these contracts with the new values. These values include both performance bond costs of $9,613.40. There are no changes to the recommendation and the low bidders remain exactly the same. The total value of the Furniture and Shelving packages is $1.3M favorable to budget.
	The Library Board approved the lowest and best bid(s) for these work packages and authorized the Director to enter into and execute the following contracts:
	- Color-Art for all the shelving and the Steelcase / Nurture / Coalese furniture items for $554,097.16.
	- CI Select for all other furniture at $1,228,527.18.
	The combined cost for all shelving and furniture for these six branches is $1,782,624.34 (Cunnane/Kenyon).
	Additional Contingency
	Steve Hunter presented a recommendation to designate additional contingency funds for the first four renovation projects (Weber Road, Rock Road, Indian Trails, and Jamestown Bluffs).
	Mr. Hunter reported that, at the February 2015 meeting, the Board approved construction contracts for these projects in the amount of $7,455,234. The Board also approved a contingency fund of $534,010 for permits, changes in the work, and unforeseen conditions. At the April 2015 meeting the Board approved an additional $92,528 (net) with the acceptance of a revised HVAC proposal for Rock Road. The construction contracts for these four branches are $1,620,450 below their allocated budget. However, Mr. Hunter stated that the extent of unforeseen conditions has been much greater than anticipated with multiple discoveries of hazardous building materials at Weber Road, a storm water drainage issue at Indian Trails that has necessitated internal remediation and will require extensive site drainage upgrades, and conflicts between the existing sanitary and storm sewer systems and the proposed foundations for the building expansions at Rock Road. These will be expensive conditions to correct and will greatly surpass the existing contingency. Designating the $1.6M difference between the actual contracts and the budgeted amount as an additional contingency will allow the timely continuation of the projects without exceeding the original project budget.
	The Library Board approved the administration’s recommendation that $1,620,450 (the difference between the total contract amount and the budget for four renovations at Weber Road, Rock Road, Indian Trails, and Jamestown Bluffs) be designated “additional contingency”. The spending of this contingency fund will be approved by Kristen Sorth, Library Director or Steve Hunter, Manager of Construction & Facilities as needed during the execution of the project (Cunnane/Kenyon).
