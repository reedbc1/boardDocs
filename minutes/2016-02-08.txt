The report was shared with the Board. Five branches were closed for construction during a large part of the year. Ms. Sorth also shared a report for Lewis & Clark and Grant’s View comparing statistics from the day each branch opened after construction through the end of January to the same time period last year.

The Boeing Employees Community Fund awarded the Library $5000 for the development of the kits that include a science activity, a book and a DVD related to the particular science topic of the kit. Ms. Sorth said that the statistics for the kits are impressive. In less than a month, 68 patrons have requested a kit and total circulation has reached 132. The most popular kit so far is the Lego Mindstorm kit. Staff from the Youth Services Department will present on the Sci-Finders kits at the Mid-America Library Alliance Children's Workshop in March. (Plan: Increase Literacy 3.1)
	·         Ms. Sorth announced that this year’s Black History Celebration will include an exciting event featuring long time St. Louis Attorney Frankie Freeman who is recognized nationally for her work in civil rights. She is the author of “A Song of Faith and Hope: The Life of Frankie Muse Freeman”. Ms. Freeman is 99 years old and will share the stage with national youth motivational speaker, Koran Bolden.

(Plan: Strengthen Sense of Community 2.1 and 2.3
	·         The Library applied for and received the following grants: Summer Reading Program Grant in the amount of $17,600 to cover the costs of a printed program guide for the Early Readers and Kids Reading Clubs, log sheets for all ages, promotional bookmarks, print ads in the newspaper and a parents’ magazine, and a Facebook ad package. Show Me Steps to Continuing Education Grant in the amount of $2,528 to bring in a trainer to teach library staff how to develop and facilitate youth and family programs that incorporate STEM and 21st century skills utilizing the technology accessible to them at their libraries.

Eric Button, Assistant Director of Branch Services, is leading a team of nine managers to Jefferson City to meet with the Library’s elected officials. One topic that will be discussed is state funding for public libraries. The proposed cuts for Missouri’s public libraries in 2016 are significant. (Plan: Strengthen Sense of Community 3.3).

Customer Connect will make appointments for patrons for AARP. CORP will make their appointments. (Plan: Increase Literacy 3.2 and 3.4)
	·         Ms. Sorth had mentioned in a previous report that the Library has implemented a new way to file materials that have been requested by patrons and are available for self pick-up. The patron identifier for those materials will be changed in a way that protects the confidentiality of our patrons by keeping their reading, listening and viewing requests as private as possible. Patrons may also choose an alias as their identifier. The Library piloted the change as the six branches under construction opened to the public. This process has gone well, and we have now implemented this process at all Library locations. (Plan: Strengthen Sense of Community 1.1).
	·         The Library’s Born to Read program, which is supported by the St. Louis County Library Foundation, will expand in 2016. St. Mary’s Hospital, St. Luke’s Hospital and Mercy Hospital have agreed to join the program. With these additions, all babies born in St. Louis County will receive a bag from the Library which contains a book, literacy information and information on how to get a library card and other library resources. This month, the Library is hosting one year birthday parties for the first group of Born to Read babies. The program at Headquarters included twenty-five babies, moms, dads, grandparents and siblings. Those attending enjoyed cupcakes and the babies received a gift of a second board book. A discussion of early literacy is also part of the program. Additional parties are taking place at Florissant Valley, Daniel Boone and Grant's View. (Plan: Increase Literacy 2.1)
	·         Ms. Sorth reported that she met recently with the Director of the Center for Hearing and Speech, which is a non-profit organization that serves both adults and children in St. Louis. Library staff and Center staff have had several meetings to discuss how we can work together. The Library will be piloting programs for adults and parents in 2016. Several topics are currently under development, including hearing loss (geared toward older adults), accent modification (for adults in which English is their second language), and baby talk (parent education on early literacy for birth to age 3. We hope to expand the partnership in 2017. (Plan: Increase Literacy 3.4)

NOLS has a relationship with Scott Briscoe who was on the first African American team to climb Mt. Denali. Scott will be coming to St. Louis this spring. We are working with NOLS to bring Scott Briscoe to speak to middle and high school students at the Lewis and Clark Branch on April 7 at 7:00 p.m. and April 8 at 10:00 a.m. The Branch Manager will be contacting the Riverview Gardens School District to coordinate a school visit for the daytime event on April 8.

	·         All branches with the newly installed vending machines continue to have issues with the performance of the machines. We have been in regular contact with the vendor since the first branch opened in October. The Library’s dissatisfaction with their performance has been escalated with the vendor and the Library has given them 30 days to improve the service. If service does not improve, the Library will change vendors for this service based on the original bid process. (Plan: Sense of Community 1)
	·         Staff from the Reference Department is now conducting outreach visits at Friendship Village West, a nursing home and assisted living facility. They are scheduling one-on-one appointments to help residents set up their devices with eMedia. If successful, this will be expanded to additional locations. In addition, Reference Department staff have started a program called Database Stars where they visit K-12 schools (usually middle school age and younger) to teach the students how to use our library databases for their research projects. Lessons and handouts are customized around what the students will be researching. Staff is also providing database training to school children coming to HQ for tours and to several community colleges. (Plan: Increase Literacy 3.3)

	·         Ms. Sorth also reported that the canoes in the children’s area have been installed at Lewis & Clark and the patrons are enjoying them. They were designed so that children can sit and read in the canoe. (Plan: Create Gathering Spaces 2.1)
	·         There are several open items for the six newly opened branches. One of these is directional signage to Grant’s View. We are working with St. Louis County and McBride Homes to gain approval for directional signs to the Library after the traffic circle. Patrons are having difficulty with the turn in to the parking lot for the branch. Once the construction on Musick Road is complete, the branch will have its own entrance and this will hopefully eliminate the confusion. (Plan: Create Gathering Spaces 1.3)
	·         There are now five branches closed for construction – Sachs, Oak Bend, Natural Bridge, Prairie Commons and Cliff Cave. Employees at those branches, Building Systems staff and the IT staff have been working very hard on closing these branches for the next round of construction. (Plan: Create Gathering Spaces)

	OLD BUSINESS
	None
	NEW BUSINESS
	ADULT PROGRAMMING
	Stacey Lewis, Adult Program Coordinator, gave a PowerPoint presentation on Adult Programming.
	Ms. Lewis said that her priorities since accepting this position in 2015 are to bring a strategic focus to adult programming, reach untapped areas and audiences, and support Library staff in their programming efforts. Examples of system wide programs and initiatives for adults include: Black History Month; National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo); Greater St. Louis Humanities Festival; Memory in Motion and The Listening Project. Ms. Lewis also showed photographs of several of these programs.
	As part of her goal to reach untapped areas and audiences, Ms. Lewis has put a lot of effort into developing partnerships with organizations such as UMSL, Mid-East Area Agency on Aging, St. Louis County Parks, and Maturity and Its Muse.
	As part of her work to support staff programming efforts, Ms. Lewis offers small group training sessions for staff; developed an Adult Programming Site with information on presenters, performers and other resources; and initiated an Adult Programming Forum for staff throughout the system.
	In answer to a question from Dr. Beckwith about the number of staff in the Adult Programming Department, Ms. Lewis responded that she was currently the only one but two new positions would be added this year. Dr. Beckwith thanked Ms. Lewis for her informative presentation.
	CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
	Steve Hunter gave an update on the Phase 1 construction projects. He said that five branches are now closed for renovation: Samuel Sachs; Oak Bend; Natural Bridge; Prairie Commons and Cliff Cave. When these branches reopen in late summer, half of the branch projects will have been completed. Design work for the Phase 2 projects is in process and space planning for the Operations Center has begun. Mr. Hunter showed photographs of the five branches currently under construction. In response to a question from Dr. Beckwith regarding which departments the Operations Center would house, Mr. Hunter said that had not yet been completely determined.
	FOOD FOR FINES
	Barbara Brain recommended approval of a “Food for Fines” option during National Library Week, April 10- 16, 2016 and annually thereafter.
	Ms. Brain reported that, for the past seventeen years, the Library has recognized National Library Week by allowing patrons to pay $10 worth of their outstanding fines with canned goods. The food is then given to Operation Food Search for distribution to local food pantries. “Food for Fines” has generated positive publicity for the Library and it also encourages the return of overdue items. Ms. Brain said that staff collected 35,431 pounds of food during “Food for Fines” week last year, the largest collection to date.
	The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation that the “Food for Fines” option be offered again during National Library Week, April 10-16, 2016 and annually thereafter to allow patrons to exchange one can of food for $1 in fines up to a maximum of $10 (Mulligan/Kenyon).
	PARTNERSHIP POLICY
	Barbara Brain reported that a Partnership Policy has been established to define the types of collaborative partnerships the Library may enter into and to provide guidance in developing and maintaining such partnerships.
	The Library has made a great effort over the past few years to develop partnerships with other organizations such as Operation Food Search, several school districts, and Gateway Greening. Partnerships such as these build on the strength of each partner and reach new or shared audiences that neither partner, working alone, could serve as effectively. In this way, partnerships help us to fulfill our Strategic Plan goal to “Strengthen our sense of community and social connectedness.”
	Ms. Brain explained that each partnership opportunity will be evaluated to determine its costs and benefits, specific responsibilities will be assigned to each partner and documented in a written agreement to be approved by the Director. The partnership policy makes it clear that the mission and policies of potential partners must be compatible with those of the Library. Ms. Brain said that the Partnership Policy had been reviewed by legal counsel and a copy was shared with the Board.
	The Library Board approved the new Partnership Policy (Cunnane/Mulligan).
	CONFIDENTIALITY OF LIBRARY RECORDS POLICY
	Barbara Brain presented the Administration’s recommendation to approve the revised Confidentiality of Library Records Policy that will replace the existing Library Card Confidentiality Policy that was last approved by the Board on August 16, 1999.
	Ms. Brain explained that this policy details the Library’s approach to maintaining the privacy of patron information and the circumstances in which that information may be shared. The revised policy emphasizes the fact that the Library complies with applicable Missouri Statutes regarding the confidentiality and disclosure of Library records. All information such as registration details, circulation, database search, and computer use records are confidential. Library staff may access these records only for the purpose of performing their assigned duties.
	The new policy also emphasizes that the Library will only disclose Library records in specific circumstances such as: in response to a properly executed court order; to contractors and consultants for use in the course of carrying out Library operations; to a recovery agent contracted by the Library for the collection of fines, fees, and nonreturned materials; and in response to a patron’s written request to release their own Library records or those of their minor children. Ms. Brain stated that the revised policy had been reviewed by legal counsel and copies of the existing and revised statements were shared with the Board.
	The Library Board approved the revised Confidentiality of Library Records Policy (Mulligan/Cunnane).
	EUREKA HILLS LEASE
	Kristen Sorth presented a recommendation for the Library Board to authorize her to extend and amend the Lease for the Eureka Hills Branch.
	Ms. Sorth reported that the Eureka Hills Branch is located in a leased space in the Eureka Towne Center in Eureka, Missouri. The lease agreement has an option to extend the lease, which expires in June, for five years until June of 2021. Per the agreement, the Library must act on this option six months prior to the expiration of the lease. The Eureka Hills Branch is not included in the Library’s current plans for replacing or renovating branches but discussions about it will take place later.  Ms. Sorth stated that this extension has been discussed with the attorneys from Lashly & Baer.
	The Library Board approved Administration’s recommendation for the Library Board to authorize the Director to extend and amend the Lease dated June 23, 2011, between THF Eureka Parcel B Development, L.P., as Landlord, and the Library District, as Tenant, for the Leased Premises located at Eureka Towne Center, consistent with the District’s planning for library improvements, facilities, services and operations in the Eureka region of the District, (2) to authorize the Director to sign, on behalf of the District, such documents as are necessary, appropriate or advisable to carry out the terms and provisions of this Motion, and the execution of such documents shall be conclusive evidence of such necessity, appropriateness or advisability, and (3) to ratify any actions of the Director taken related thereto (Kenyon/Mulligan).
	INVESTMENT OF 2016 OPERATING FUNDS
	Kris Mooney presented the Administration’s recommendation for the selection of First Bank for investment of the $34 million of 2016 operating funds.
	Mr. Mooney shared the results of the Library’s Request for Investment Rates with the Board. He explained that the request was sent to nine St. Louis area banks and one Kansas City area bank.  Three banks returned rate quotes: First Bank, BOKF and Commerce Bank.
	The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for the selection of First Bank who returned the highest total rate of return at .569% for the entire portfolio (Cunnane/Mulligan).
	PENSION PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS
	Kristen Sorth and Kris Mooney presented the Pension Board’s recommendation to change the mortality table assumption.
	Milliman, the Library Pension Plan’s Actuary, annually reviews actuarial methods and assumptions used in the annual Actuarial Valuation which determines the Library’s annual contribution, funding percentage, and unfunded liability. At the February Pension Board Meeting, Milliman presented a recommendation for a change in the Pension Plan’s mortality table assumption.
	Milliman is recommending the mortality table assumption be changed as follows:
	            Current assumption:
	·         Pre-Retirement:  RP2000 Employees Mortality Table
	·         Post-Retirement:  RP2000 Healthy Annuitant Mortality Table
	·         Mortality Improvements: Full Generational Adjustments using Scale AA
	            Proposed assumption
	·         Pre-Retirement:  RP2014 Employees Mortality Table
	·         Post-Retirement:  RP2014 Healthy Annuitant Mortality Table
	·         Mortality Improvements: Full Generational Adjustments using Scale MP2015
	The Pension Board reviewed Milliman’s recommendation and believes it is in the best interest of
	participants in the Pension Plan to accept the changes to the mortality table assumption. The Pension Board formally approved the changes at the February Board Meeting.
	The Library Board approved the Pension Board’s recommendation for the Library Board to accept Milliman’s recommendation to change the mortality table assumption. The recommendation will also authorize the Director of the Library to amend the Pension Plan document to incorporate the actuarial changes recommended by Milliman (Cunnane/Kenyon).
	PENSION BOARD ORGANIZATION
	Ms. Sorth reported that the Library District’s Pension Plan states in Section 2.3: “Trustees shall elect a President, Vice-President and Secretary from among their number.” The current officers are as follows:
	President                     Vacant
