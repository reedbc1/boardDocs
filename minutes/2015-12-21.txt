The report contains a variety of statistical information for the Library including circulation, visits, pc usage and program attendance, which is up slightly from this time last year.  This month, the report also includes information about Lewis & Clark’s first full month back in service.  Program attendance is up by 300%.  In addition, there have been 368 new cards issued at the branch which is an 87% increase over last year. The most popular items in the collection are also included on the dashboard.
		·         The American Library Association (ALA) solicits program proposals from libraries that wish to present at upcoming conferences.  Stacey Lewis, Adult Program Coordinator, and Susie Bushnell, Assistant Branch Manager – Daniel Boone, submitted a proposal for the 2016 ALA Annual Conference entitled “Not Your Grandma’s Bridge Group:  Community Partnerships and Programs for Older Adults.”  Their program was selected and they will present next June.  Congratulations to Stacey and Susie. (Strategic Plan: Strengthen Sense of Community 1.2)
		·         This month, the Library began a soft launch of a new online learning platform called Universal Class.  The official launch will take place in January.  Library patrons have access to a unique online education experience including classes on exercise and fitness, entrepreneurship, art and music, parenting and family, home and garden, homeschooling and many more. (Strategic Plan: Increase Literacy 3.4)
		·         On November 16, the Library sent “We Miss You” emails to over 13,000 patrons who have not used their library card in three months or more.  Of those that received the email, 10% have used their cards and have checked out 1773 items.  Jamestown Bluffs had the highest number at 21% followed by Daniel Boone with 9%.  (Strategic Plan: Strengthen Sense of Community 1.1 and 1.2)
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that last year, the Library started a telescope lending program with two donated telescopes from the St. Louis Astronomical Society and funding from the Foundation and a donor to purchase eight additional telescopes.  The program has been extremely popular.  Currently, the Library has 519 patrons on the waiting list for a telescope.  The St. Louis Astronomical Society has been monitoring our usage and would like to donate two more telescopes for placement in libraries with the longest waiting list, Grant’s View and Thornhill.  We are also planning to purchase ten additional telescopes so every branch has at least one telescope to loan to patrons. (Plan: Increase Literacy 3.4)
		·         Ms. Sorth said the Library hosted many programs during October and November to celebrate National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo).  The programs were a tremendous success with 217 local authors attending workshops at various branches. (Strategic Plan: Strengthen Sense of Community 2.3)
		·         Last month, Ms. Sorth mentioned an upcoming partnership between the St. Louis Symphony and the Library and presented the Board with details about events for children.  The adult portion of the partnership will begin in 2016 with coffee concerts on February 19, March 18 and April 22.  Participants will leave from HQ and will ride on a motor coach to and from Powell Hall for the concert.  A retired symphony musician will be on the coach for a question and answer session on the ride to Powell Hall.  (Strategic Plan: Sense of Community 2.3)
		·         Ms. Sorth said the Library is partnering with Tom Meuser, the head of the Gerontology Department at UMSL, and Maturity and Its Muse to host life review workshops.  The UMSL Life Review Project offers older adults an opportunity to record life stories to share with family and future generations.  The programs will take place at Rock Road in February, Daniel Boone in March, and Grant’s View in April.  Following the workshops we will be connecting 15-18 seniors with UMSL students who will conduct a life review interview and produce a video for the seniors to document their personal life stories.  The participants in the life review project will receive a DVD copy of their life review story.   (Strategic Plan: Strengthen Sense of Community 2.3)
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that the Library will be making a change to the computer lab at Lewis & Clark based on the needs of the community.  The instruction lab will be offered as a family computing area when computer classes are not being taught.  Some basic children's furniture and activities will be set up at the rear of the room to allow kids the opportunity to play, read, color, etc while their caregiver uses a nearby computer.  The quiet computer lab will still be available for patrons wishing to work in a quieter environment.  A similar model is being discussed for the new lab at Natural Bridge Branch. (Strategic Plan:  Create Gathering Spaces 1.2 and 1.3)
		·         Branches with the newly installed vending machines have had a number of issues with the performance of the machines.  The vendor is aware, but the issues will be escalated in importance if the problems continue and are repeated at branches that will soon be opening.  These concerns will be discussed with the vendor.  Eric is also working on the development of a refund procedure through Avendco.
		·         The Reference Department will be making some changes to the Library’s Small Business program since attendance has declined recently. The most recent expo went well with 43 attendees.  Barbara Brain and Michelle Sawicki, Manager of Reference, met with Lynette Watson from the University of Missouri - Extension last week to develop a future plan for the small business series. The Library will offer fewer sessions each year and also begin targeting established small business owners to a greater degree. Programs will be planned ahead for the entire year to make promotion easier. (Strategic Plan: Increase Literacy 3.2)
		·         Ms. Sorth said there were many mentions of the St. Louis County Library in the local media in print, radio and television.  Those articles were shared with Board members. (Strategic Plan: Strengthen Sense of Community 1.2)

		·         As the Library opens new branches or re-opens renovated branches, staff is documenting lessons learned and suggestions from branch employees in order to refine and improve our design process for the next round of construction.   Ms. Sorth and Steve Hunter have started meeting with staff prior to the branches opening to answer any questions they may have about the building or construction process.  In addition, we have developed a system to collect all building requests for new or renovated branches. (Plan: Strengthen Sense of Community: 2.1)
		·         Ms. Sorth said that there is a massive team effort involved in preparing the branches to open to the public.  The Building Systems staff and the IT staff have been working hard on both closing the branches for the next round of construction and re-opening the branches.

		OLD BUSINESS
		2016 BUDGET
		Kris Mooney presented the 2016 Budget. He stated that the document was prepared and approved by the Budget Committee consisting of the following individuals:
		Kristen Sorth – Director
		Barbara Brain - Assistant Director, Adult & Support Services
		Barbara Turkington - Assistant Director, Advancement
		Gib Van Cleve – Assistant Director, ITS
		Eric Button – Assistant Director, Branch Services

		Mr. Mooney said that the Library Budget is a spending guideline for the upcoming year. Projects discussed in the Budget document will be individually presented to the Library Board for review and approval as outlined in the Library Board’s By-Laws. The Budget Revision is presented to the Board in September. The 2016 Budget was first presented at the November Library Board meeting as an informational item to give Board members time to review the Budget document, ask questions and for Administration to respond. In response to Dr. Beckwith’s question about the budget process, Mr. Mooney explained that he meets individually with each administrator to discuss budget needs in view of the Library’s strategic plan goals. The Budget Committee then meets as a group to review and approve the document and Ms. Sorth has the final say on items included in the budget. The Library Board approved the 2016 Budget (Cunnane/Tai).
		NEW BUSINESS
		2015-2018 STRATEGIC PLAN UPDATE
		Marie Conlin presented an update on the 2015-2018 Strategic Plan approved by the Board on October 20, 2014. Ms. Conlin explained that the plan is arranged into three major areas of focus: increasing literacy, strengthening the sense of community, and creating gathering spaces.
		For 2015, 89 activities were identified in support of the Strategic Plan. 81 of those activities plus an additional 30 will continue throughout 2016.
		Ms. Conlin highlighted some of the Strategic Plan activities staff was engaged in this year as well as some of the additional 2016 activities.
		In 2015, a great deal of effort went into communicating with the public regarding construction progress, branch closings and reopenings and this work will continue into 2016. Also in 2016, the Library will undertake a project to revamp its web presence and look for opportunities to increase Library card registration, an effort that began in 2015 as part of the President’s National ConnectED Library Challenge.
		Ms. Conlin concluded by stating that much of the work on the Creating Gathering Spaces portion of the plan is in the construction projects that will add living rooms, dynamic children’s spaces and collaborative meeting areas to all new and renovated branches.
		CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
		Steve Hunter reported on the Phase 1 construction projects. He stated that Grant’s View will open to the public the following day and Rock Road will follow in mid January. Samuel Sachs, the first of the Phase 1B(B) renovation projects, closed on December 12 and interior demolition work began today.  The rest of the Phase 1B(B) branches, Oak Bend, Natural Bridge, Prairie Commons and Cliff Cave, will close in January. Mr. Hunter shared photographs of the Rock Road and Weber Road renovations showing the vibrant, modern interiors. Mr. Hunter also discussed some of the floor plan changes that will be made to the Phase 1B(B) locations, such as the afterhours computer center at Natural Bridge, the change to the location of the entrance at Cliff Cave and the addition of a window to overlook the community garden.
		BOND CONTRACT
		Steve Hunter presented a recommendation to approve a Second Amendment to the Facilities Master Plan Phase 1B Architectural and Engineering Services Agreement.
		Mr. Hunter explained that, during the design and construction of the nine Phase 1B project renovations, several unforeseen conditions and Library-requested changes arose that are not in the original contract scope. The additional work undertaken to address these items necessitates an amendment to the Architectural and Engineering Services Agreement between the Library and Bond Architects.
		Based on the additional services performed, Bond Architects is entitled to $260,528 in additional compensation. Their total compensation will be adjusted to a not-to-exceed amount of $2,168,236. Mr. Hunter shared the proposed Second Amendment to the Agreement with the Board and stated that Lashly & Baer had reviewed the Amendment and incorporated suggested language.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to approve the Second Amendment to the Facilities Master Plan Phase 1B Architectural and Engineering Services Agreement and authorized the Director to enter into and execute that amendment (Cunnane/Tai).
		GRANT'S VIEW ADDITIONAL CONTINGENCY
		Steve Hunter presented the Administration’s recommendation to transfer $50,000 from the overall Program contingency to the Grant’s View project contingency.
		Mr. Hunter stated that, in August 2014, the Library Board had approved contracts for the construction of the Grant’s View Branch totaling $9,593,639 as well as a contingency fund of $479,061 for permits, changes in the work, and unforeseen conditions. Early on in the project, site issues arose that accounted for approximately 30% of the original contingency.
		Approximately $50,000 in additional funds will be transferred as Grant’s View nears completion. Mr. Hunter explained that these funds are already approved and are part of the overall Phase 1 Program contingency and requested approval to transfer these funds from the overall contingency to the project-specific Grant’s View contingency.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to transfer $50,000 from the overall Program contingency to the Grant’s View project contingency. As with all construction related funds, the spending of this contingency will be approved by Kristen Sorth, Library Director and/or Steve Hunter, Manager of Construction & Facilities as needed during the execution of the project (Kenyon/Cunnane).
		SHARED SERVICES AGREEMENT
		Kristen Sorth presented a recommendation for approval of the annual Shared Services Agreement between the Library and the Library Foundation.
		Ms. Sorth explained that the Shared Services Agreement defines the level of support provided by the Library to the Foundation and is a requirement of the Affiliation Agreement between the Library and the Foundation. The Foundation Board’s Executive Committee has reviewed the document and their recommendations have been incorporated to more accurately reflect the level of support provided for the Foundation by the Library.
		In addition, the Foundation Board agrees to reimburse the Library for up to 100% of the salaries for the Manager, Development and the Friends Coordinator who utilize 100% of their time in performing services for the Foundation. The agreement has been revised to reflect the level of support as determined and voted on by the Foundation Board. The final version of the document was shared with the Board.
		The Library Board approved Administration’s and the Library Foundation Board’s recommendation for approval of the annual Shared Services Agreement. This agreement supersedes and thereby terminates the Shared Services Agreement dated January 1, 2015. The term of this new agreement will begin on January 1, 2016 and terminate on December 31, 2016 (Cunnane/Tai).
		PHOTOGRAPHY AND RECORDING POLICY
		Barbara Brain presented a recommendation to approve the revised Photography and Recording Policy that will replace an existing Photo Policy that has been in place since April 30, 2009.
		Ms. Brain stated that the Photography and Recording Policy has been established to govern photography and video and/or audio recording by Library staff and members of the public. The revised policy statement emphasizes the fact that the Library reserves the right to take photographs or recordings of its programs, events and other activities and use them in promotional materials.
		The policy makes it clear that photography or recording by the public requires the prior permission of Library staff and commercial photography requires the express written permission of the Director or the Director’s designee. It also emphasizes the fact that photography or recording should not interfere with the provision of Library services nor violate personal privacy. Ms. Brain explained that the Photography and Recording Policy had been reviewed by legal counsel.
		The Library Board approved the revised Photography and Recording Policy (Cunnane/Kenyon).
		COLLECTION HQ
		Barbara Brain presented the Administration’s recommendation for the purchase of Collection HQ (CHQ), a web based collection evaluation and management product that is currently in use in over 6,000 libraries worldwide.
		Ms. Brain explained that CHQ will give staff the ability to quickly and easily track the performance of materials by location and by item; develop spending plans based on the circulation of specific areas of the collection; and set the holds to copies ratio so that staff will be alerted when it’s necessary to purchase additional copies to meet demand. CHQ will also help to identify materials that are under-used at one branch so that they can be moved to another location where similar materials are circulating better.
		Ms. Brain stated that CHQ is owned by Baker & Taylor which is the single source for this product. The subscription price is normally $36,000 but the following pricing has been offered for a three year subscription to CHQ:
		· Year 1: $18,000
		· Year 2: $27,000
		· Year 3: $32,400
		The one-time $10,000 set-up fee has been reduced to $1,500. $19,500 is included in the 2016 budget specifically for this service.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for the purchase of Collection HQ for a three year period at a cost of $19,500 for 2016; $27,000 for 2017; and $32,400 for 2018. The cost will be paid out of the collection development budget (Cunnane/Kenyon).
		ADJOURNMENT
		Edith Cunnane moved to adjourn the meeting and Chingling Tai seconded.  All voiced approval.
		The meeting adjourned at 4:40 p.m.
