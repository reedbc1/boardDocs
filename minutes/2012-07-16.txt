ST. LOUIS COUNTY LIBRARY DISTRICT
	MEETING OF THE BOARD
	​TELEPHONE CONFERENCE
	​MONDAY, JULY 16, 2012
	3 P.M.
	The monthly meeting of the Board of the St. Louis County Library District was held via telephone conference on Monday, July 16, 2012.  The agenda had been posted in all branches of the Library District at least 24 hours before the meeting.
	ATTENDANCE
	​Board Members Present: (all by telephone)
	Lynn Beckwith, President
	Edith Cunnane, Vice President
	Elena Kenyon, Treasurer
	Chingling Tai, Secretary
	Steve Sachs, Member
	ADMINISTRATOR’S AND GUESTS ATTENDING:
	Charles Pace, Director; Paul Zemitzsch, Sequel, LLC, and  Sandra Williams Executive Assistant.
	INFORMATIVE  RADIO  ADVERTISING
	Mr. Pace recommended the Library purchase a series of radio spots aimed at raising awareness of the St. Louis County Library system. The informational spots are intended to highlight four key elements of the library we believe are mostly unknown to the public:
		Educational services beyond books: free computer classes, GED assistance, job search assistance, author lectures, etc. Also, diversity of users in 20 neighborhood branches.
		The statistical breadth of the library system: numbers of children in summer reading classes, more than one million using the library’s computers, six million visits that are more than all local professional sports teams attendance combined, largest and busiest library system in Missouri, record-breaking visits in 2012, etc.
		Relevance of libraries in the age of the iPad and Kindle: Why libraries are still important.
	These radio spots do not advocate any ballot issues or proposals. Our motivation is to explain to the general public what they are getting for their tax dollars and how successful and prudent the County library system is. The takeaway we hope to achieve is a better understanding of how the library system impacts our communities and encourage moderate or non-users of the library to take a fresh look at what is offered and to come into their branch.
	Mr. Pace said he would ask the Foundation to give $25,000 toward the ads and the Library would pay the money up front anticipating a reimbursement.
	Mr. Zemitzsch said he would make sure the Board received a list of the radio stations where air time was being purchased and would include the information and text of the ads.
	Mrs. Cunnane made a motion to approve the funds and Mrs. Kenyon seconded.  Voice approval was given by Dr. Tai, Mr. Sachs and Dr. Beckwith.
	LEWIS AND CLARK BRANCH
	Mr. Pace mentioned a blog that was discussing the replacement of the Lewis and Clark Branch.  He told the board that he had responded to several inquiries regarding the subject.
	ADJOURN THE MEETING
	Mrs. Cunnane motioned to adjourn the meeting and Mrs. Kenyon seconded.  All approved by voice vote.  The meeting ended at 3:14 p.m.
	Respectfully Submitted,
