		o   $3,938 for Spotlight on Literacy focusing on health programming for seniors
		o   $2,999 for Summer Reading Club
		The District incurred a cost of $130,312 in database subscriptions in January since many of the Library’s database subscriptions renew at the beginning of the year. The most popular databases purchased this month were for general academic use (student research) and newspapers.
		The Library District renewed the annual software maintenance with our Integrated Library System vendor, Innovative Interfaces Incorporated (III), for the District’s Millennium software at a cost of $159,196.
		In January, $36,500 plus a one-time set up fee of $1,500 was paid to Bridgeall Libraries Limited for an annual subscription to Collection HQ. Collection HQ will provide additional efficiency in purchasing decisions and managing the District’s collection. Bridgeall is owned by Baker & Taylor, a vendor from whom the Library District purchases many collection materials. As an incentive to purchase Collection HQ, Baker & Taylor agreed to give the Library District a credit of $18,000 against future materials purchases bringing the net cost for Collection HQ to $18,000. The Board approved this purchase on December 21, 2015.

		DIRECTOR'S REPORT
		Kristen Sorth gave the following report.
		Library Update
		·         Ms. Sorth shared the dashboard report for March with the Board. She stated that the dashboard report contains a variety of statistical information for the Library including circulation, visits, program sessions and program attendance for February.  This month the report also includes statistics about the Library’s mobile app usage and social media statistics.  In February, the Library posted on Facebook about the expansion of the Born to Read program to additional hospitals as well as the addition of a library card in the packet.  About 24,000 people viewed the post, it generated 940 likes and was shared over 260 times.  The exposure was completely organic.  People responded very favorably to the message that every child born in the County would be given an opportunity to receive a library card.
		·         Ms. Sorth said she had mentioned several months ago that the Library is participating in the Pollinator Project.  This is a new initiative that the Butterfly House and St. Louis County Parks are launching to encourage the planting of pollinator gardens and educate children and their families about the importance of pollinators.  The project kicked off on March 15th with a celebration at the Butterfly House.  The County Executive issued a proclamation about the project and the Library was mentioned in remarks by Tom Curran from the County Executive’s Office.  Barbara Brain and Ms. Sorth attended the event. (Plan: Create Gathering Spaces 2.3)
		·         Plans for the Summer Reading Club are underway and involve kick-off parties at HQ, Daniel Boone, Florissant Valley and Grant’s View.  The event at each location will include an outdoor climbing wall from Upper Limits, performers and other fun activities for families.  As mentioned previously, the Library has made some changes to the program.  One change is a reward at the mid-point which will include a book and one night of pool access at one of the four St. Louis County parks.  Ms. Sorth said that the library staff has been working with St. Louis County on this reward.  (Increase Literacy 2.3)
		·         As mentioned in a previous report, the Library has been working on scheduling pet adoption days at the Library with the Animal Protection Agency (APA).  They will be held at HQ, DB, FV, and GV in April and May.  The animals and the events will be outside, weather permitting.  (Plan: Sense of Community 2.3)
		·         A redesign of the Library’s website was included in the 2016 Library budget.  Jennifer McBride and Gib Van Cleve are working on the RFQ for this service.  Administration will present a recommendation to the Library Board in the next several months and are looking forward to presenting a new website later this year.  The website was last updated in 2011.   (Plan: Sense of Community 1.2)
		·         Ms. Sorth said that the Library is working with a new non-profit called We Stories.  We Stories offer a literature-based program to help parents initiate discussions with their children about race and racism. The We Stories Family Learning Program curriculum consists of a number of "core" titles that directly address the monthly theme (April's theme is Unique and Wonderful Me!) and "companion" titles that build on the main theme. The Library is supporting this initiative by having multiple copies of all of the We Stories titles available in our collection so that participating families have easy access to them. The Library currently has 14 core and companion titles in the collection.  These are indentified in the Library catalog as “We Stories” to assist patrons with searching for the books.  SLCL is also in discussions to develop kits related to the selected titles that would include a related activity for parents and children. (Increase Literacy 1.3 and 2.1)
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that she recently met with the CEO of the Visiting Nurses Association and thanked Barbara Turkington for the connection.  She discussed a number of collaborative opportunities between the association and the Library including flu shots and other vaccinations for patrons and educational programs for adults.  Stacey Lewis, the Library’s Adult Program Coordinator, is in discussion with the VNA about these opportunities. (Increase Literacy 3.4)
		·         The Library ConnetED Challenge expands to two additional school districts.  Eric Button delivered 3124 cards to the Riverview Gardens School District on March 16th.  The Library has received a Memorandum of Understanding from the Ritenour School District and will proceed with the process to create and deliver library cards to their students.  The Library was contacted by the Clayton School District and has started the process with them as well.   Ms. Sorth and Eric will attend the Parkway Board of Education Meeting in April to talk about the Challenge.  Staff plans to reach out to EducationPlus to assist with efforts to bring library cards to additional school districts in 2016. (Increase Literacy 1)
		·         Ms. Sorth said that a few weeks ago she was contacted by Susan Rollins, Executive Director of the Housing Authority of St. Louis County. Ms. Rollins was interested in having some kind of library service for children and adults at two of their public housing developments, Arbor Hill and Highview. The Library is in the process of setting up Recycled Reads at both sites.  SLCL will also offer some programs and encourage residents to participate in the Summer Reading Club.  There are 171 children at the two locations. (Plan: Sense of Community 2.2)
		·         Development Strategies, an economic development advisory firm, was asked to address the following questions in the wake of several major challenges, setbacks, and successes in the St. Louis metropolitan area: What regions do it best? Why? What are the best practices? How might St. Louis get there? Ms. Sorth said she was asked to attend a meeting with a group of ten other individuals to discuss these issues. She said she was honored to be asked and thrilled that a public library was part of the discussion. She said the meeting was very insightful and the discussion will continue.  Ms. Sorth will keep the Board updated on the progress. (Plan: Sense of Community 1.2)
		·         Ms. Sorth said she mentioned at the February Board Meeting that all branches with the newly installed vending machines continue to have issues with the performance of the machines. Staff has been in regular contact with the vendor since the first branch opened in October. Staff dissatisfaction with their performance was escalated with the vendor and they were given 30 days to improve the service. The Library was clear that if the service did not improve, our intent was to change vendors for this service based on the original bid process.  Thirty days have passed and the Library continues to be dissatisfied with the service. During the thirty days, staff has documented complaints from the public, as well as concerns expressed by managers, with the performance of the vending machines. Staff notified the vendor, using the language provided to us by legal counsel, that we are terminating the contract.  We will be switching to the next vendor, Griesedieck Vending, who submitted during the original bid process.  (Plan: Sense of Community 1)
		·         St. Louis County Library has been selected by FOCUS St. Louis to receive the 2016 What’s Right with the Region award. The Library District was chosen in the Demonstrating Innovative Solutions category. Honorees in this category have been recognized for their innovation and vision in making the St. Louis region a better place to live, work or visit. SLCL was honored for its programs that promote early literacy, including the recent change eliminating fines on children’s material, the expansion of the Born to Read program for newborns, the free summer lunch program, and the library’s participation in President Obama’s ConnectED Library Challenge.  These programs are among the many efforts St. Louis County Library makes to eliminate barriers to literacy. The 19th Annual What’s Right with the Region Awards celebration is Thursday, May 12 at the Sheldon Concert Hall. (Plan: Sense of Community 1.2)
		·         There were mentions of the St. Louis County Library in the local media in print, radio and television.  Those articles were shared with the Board. (Plan: Strengthen Sense of Community 1.2)
		·         Ms. Sorth showed a number of photos to the Board from several programs and events including: STArt; Rapunzel at HQ, Crafty Café; African Bead Jewelry at Lewis and Clark, Future Cartoonist Society at Grant’s View, Automata Workshop at Florissant Valley, and Little Budding Artists at HQ, SLCL Telescope Assembly at Florissant Valley, Markus Zusak at HQ and STArt: Duct Tape Art at HQ.

		·         Staff is conducting inventories of five branch collections that are currently housed in the warehouse while their branch is renovated.
		Library Foundation
		·         With the expansion of Born to Read (BTR), the Foundation is expanding their fundraising efforts for the program. Aetna and Cardinals Care are now corporate sponsors of the program.  In addition to supplying an item to be included in the BTR bag, the Cardinals are filming a news feature about the program to be included in their weekly magazine TV show and on their website.  The Foundation has scheduled a fundraising reception for the Born to Read program on April 13 at Bixby's in the Missouri History Museum. The County Executive has issued a proclamation declaring April 13th Born to Read Day in St. Louis County.  The expansion of the program is proceeding and St. Louis County Library cards are now included in the BTR bag.  The card comes with an online form that parents fill out for their child or themselves to get a library card.  Volunteers from UPS were at the Library last week to assemble the bags for the hospitals.  They plan to come each month to assist.  The BTR birthday parties were held at HQ, Grant’s View, Florissant Valley and Daniel Boone.  204 babies and adults attended the parties. (Plan: Increase Literacy 2.1)
		·         Aetna will also be sponsoring the installation of the Community Garden at Grant’s View.  (Plan: Create Gathering Spaces 2.3)
		·         Since last summer, Ms. Sorth said she’s been talking with Sunny Schaefer, Executive Director of Operation Food Search, about improving the quality of lunches for the Library’s Summer Free Lunch program.  She has been working with the Foundation on fundraising for this program.  Last month, Ms. Sorth mentioned a $5000 donor and the Library has since received support from a second donor for $5000 who wishes to sponsor the program. (Increase Literacy 3.4)
		·         Three bestselling children’s authors will visit Library Headquarters starting this month as part of a new Sunday Author Series. The series includes events with Caldecott-winning illustrator Peter Brown; Australian children’s author Andy Griffiths and National Book Award-winning author Sherman Alexie. (Increase Literacy 1.2)
		·         The 1000 Books Before Kindergarten program will begin in 2016. This initiative was started by the 1000 Books Foundation to promote reading and encourage parent/child bonding through reading. The concept is to encourage families to read 1000 books to their child before he/she reaches kindergarten.  Ms. Sorth and Jim Bogart met with PNC and submitted a grant request for the program.  The Library received a generous three-year commitment of $40,000 from PNC Bank to fund the program. (Plan: Increase Literacy 2.1)

The Library Foundation will receive a portion of the funds raised by these bins.  Legal counsel has reviewed the contract for the Foundation. (Plan: Create Gathering Spaces 1)
		OLD BUSINESS
		NONE
		NEW BUSINESS
		CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
		Steve Hunter reported that five renovation projects are currently in progress at Sachs, Oak Bend, Natural Bridge, Prairie Commons and Cliff Cave. The schematic design process is close to completion for the first three (Daniel Boone, Florissant Valley and Bridgeton Trails) Phase 2 projects with the next step being design development. Mr. Hunter stated that some preliminary work had been done on the Operations Center and Mid County projects and that the administration would be looking at potential sites for the Operations Center and Meramec Valley.
		Mr. Hunter also reported that the minority participation for Phase 1b construction projects was 15.5%. Photos of the branches currently under construction and interior plans for the Phase 2 projects were shared with the Board.
		2015 LIBRARY AUDITS
		Kris Mooney introduced Rick Gratza, the partner at the Library’s Auditor, Kerber, Eck & Braeckel (KEB) who oversees the Library’s audit. Mr. Gratza reported on the 2015 independent Library audit which also includes the operation of the Library Foundation. The audit was shared with the Board. Mr. Gratza stated that KEB has issued an unmodified opinion and explained that an opinion is said to be “unmodified” when the auditor has no reservations concerning the financial statements. This is also known as a “clean opinion” meaning that the financial statements appear to be presented fairly in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
		The Library Board approved the acceptance of the independent audit. Copies of the audit will be sent to the State Auditor and State Library as required by State Statute. The audit will also be available on the Library’s website (Cunnane/Mulligan).
		2016 PENSION CONTRIBUTION
		Kris Mooney presented a recommendation to authorize the budgeted amount of $2,500,000 as the Library’s annual contribution to the Pension Plan.
		Mr. Mooney reported that the pension contribution from the Library to the Pension Plan is due each year on March 31. The Library’s Actuary, Milliman, has conducted the annual actuarial valuation and recommended a contribution of $1,769,272. The Library’s 2016 budget for this expense is $2,500,000. The net position as a percentage of total pension liability (previously known as the funded ratio) is 81.9%, down from 92.5% last year. The decline was due in part to a portfolio market loss of -1.93% for the 2015 year. Additionally, the Library Board adopted an updated mortality table assumption to be used in the plan’s annual valuation. The mortality table assumption was approved by the Board at the February 8, 2016 meeting. The updated mortality table assumes longer lives for pensioners, thus more liability to the Plan.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to authorize the budgeted amount of $2,500,000 as the annual contribution to the Pension Plan, which exceeds the amount recommended by the Library’s actuaries (Kenyon/Mulligan). This amount was approved by the Pension Board.
		INSURANCE RENEWALS
		Kris Mooney presented a recommendation regarding insurance carrier quotes.
		Mr. Mooney reported that all lines of the Library’s insurance policies renew each year on April 1. The Daniel and Henry Company, the Library’s broker for these services, marketed the Library District’s account to several carriers. A letter was shared with the Board from John Drew along with a summary of the April 1, 2016 renewal quote from this year compared to prior year cost.
		Mr. Mooney stated that Daniel and Henry is recommending that the Library District make a change for most lines of coverage to The Hartford Company, with a few of the smaller coverages provided by Travelers Casualty & Surety Company and ACE American (Chubb) Insurance Companies. Total cost to the Library District for continuing coverages will be $379,879 compared to $449,948 from last year. Daniel and Henry was able to obtain several decreases in cost while increasing the insurance coverage in many areas such as Property and Directors and Officers/Crime/Employment related coverage. Daniel and Henry also recommended the Library District obtain coverage in two new areas: Sexual Assault/Molestation/Abuse and Cyber Liability. These insurances together will add $18,979 in cost bringing the total cost for all coverages to $406,563. The Pension Plan pays for the Fiduciary coverage which will be $7,705 in 2016 compared to $8,605 in 2015.
		The Library Board approved administration’s recommendation in consultation with The Daniel and Henry Company to accept the quotes from the insurance carriers which include The Hartford Company, Travelers Casualty & Surety Company of America and Ace American Insurance Company for a total cost of $406,563 (Cunnane/Mulligan).
		FURNITURE AND SHELVING SELECTION
		Steve Hunter presented a recommendation on the furniture and shelving bid packages for the five Phase 1Bb branch renovation projects.
		Mr. Hunter explained that the bid packages for Cliff Cave, Natural Bridge, Oak Bend, Prairie Commons, and Samuel Sachs were released to the public as a combined offering on February 16, 2016. The bid packages were developed exclusively around open lines and bidders were invited to bid on shelving, furniture, or both as long as the bids covered all five branches. The bid was posted in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the St. Louis American, the Daily Record, and on our website.  All requirements of the Library’s bid procedure were followed.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for the lowest and best bid for each component of this work package and authorized the Director to enter into and execute the contracts listed below:
		 - Shelving at five 1Bb branches: Color-Art Integrated Interiors for $383,105.71.
		 - Furniture at five 1Bb branches: CI Select for $815,857.45.
		 The combined cost for all shelving and furniture for these five branches is $1,198,963.16 (Cunnane/Mulligan).
		FLEET VEHICLES
		Mary Arnhart presented the Administration’s recommendation on the purchase of Library fleet vehicles.
		Ms. Arnhart reported that the 2016 Library budget included the purchase of two new Library vehicles. The Library currently owns two 2005 Ford Focus vehicles as part of the fleet and the cost of the new vehicles will be offset by the trade in values of these vehicles. An Invitation for Bid for two new Dodge Grand Caravans was issued on February 5, 2016. The Library only received one bid. That response was not opened and the due date was extended for one week in order to solicit more responses. Two responses were received at the bid opening on March 8, 2016.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to accept the lowest bid from Royal Gate Automotive Group in the amount of $22,114 per vehicle. These vehicle purchases were included in the 2016 Library budget in the amount of $30,000 per vehicle (Mulligan/Cunnane).
		NOVELIST SELECT AND LIBRARY AWARE
		Barbara Brain presented a recommendation to approve the purchase of Novelist Select and Library Aware.
		Ms. Brain reported that the Collection Development Committee identified and evaluated two subscription services, Novelist Select and Library Aware that will help in efforts to increase patron awareness of all the books and other resources available through the Library. Novelist Select is a readers’ advisory tool that will enrich our catalog entries with recommended reads, reader reviews, professional reviews, related electronic resource recommendations and links to related events such as author events. Library Aware includes templates and tools that will help to promote books and resources throughout the Library. Readers’ Advisory staff will be able to create personalized reading lists for patrons interested in receiving suggestions customized to their reading tastes. Patrons will also be able to sign up to receive electronic newsletters with reading recommendations in the genre of their choice.
		Ms. Brain explained that the Library has subscribed to Novelist Plus, a popular Readers’ Advisory database, for several years. Novelist Plus, Novelist Select and Library Aware are available from Ebsco Information Services, the single source for these products. Since Novelist Plus is a patron database, it is exempt from the need for Board approval but the Library has been offered a 20% discount for the Novelist Complete package consisting of all three products. Funds were included in the 2016 budget for the purchase of these products.
		The Library Board approved the administration’s recommendation to purchase Novelist Complete which consists of Novelist Plus, Novelist Select and Library Aware at a total cost of $25,000. The cost will be paid out of the software budget (Mulligan/Cunnane).
		ADJOURNMENT
		Michael Mulligan made a motion to adjourn the meeting. Mrs. Kenyon seconded. All approved with voice vote.
		The Library Board meeting adjourned at 4:49 p.m.
		 Respectfully submitted,
