		$7,037 was paid to Rock Road Trailer for a new, enclosed cargo trailer for Building Systems. The trailer will be used to move materials in and out of the branches during construction and to transport large items from Headquarters to the branches. This purchase was included in the 2014 Budget.
		The District Paid $9,125 to Burgeon Group. This amount represents a 50% deposit on the purchase of early literacy interactive panels. The purchase is being funded by the Racing to Read grant issued by the State of Missouri and awarded to the Library in May, 2014. The panels will be installed at 7 locations: Headquarters; Daniel Boone; Florissant Valley; Tesson Ferry; Lewis and Clark; Grand Glaize; and Cliff Cave.
		Capital Projects Fund Balance Sheet
		Total Construction in Progress for June was $143,121. The expenses included $109,678 for architect’s fees, $12,530 for legal expenses and $20,913 for the services of our Facilities Master Plan Administrator.
		The Library Board approved the Treasurer’s Report subject to audit (Cunnane/Tai).
		DIRECTOR’S REPORT
		Ms. Sorth presented the following report.
		Facilities Master Plan Update
		South County Regional Branch
		Ms. Sorth reported that the request for bids for the South County Regional Branch were issued on July 8 with responses due on July 29.

		Certificates of Participation
		Ms. Sorth said the Library has completed all of the steps required for the annual continuing disclosure reporting with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) through the Electronic Municipal Market Access (“EMMA”).
		Library Update
		·         A copy of the “dashboard” report for June was shared with the Board. This month’s report includes statistics about circulation, programming, visits and the most popular items from our collection during the month of June.  It also lists the top five public libraries in the State of Missouri, based on circulation and visits, and shows circulation trends for St. Louis County Library, Mid-Continent Library, St. Charles City-County Library and St. Louis Public Library.
		·         The Library has been offering the Free Lunch program, coordinated by Operation Food Search, at three of our locations since the beginning of June 2014.  The program has been very successful.   Florissant Valley has served 2129 meals and averages an attendance of 90 participants daily.  Rock Road has served 2249 meals and averages an attendance of 115 participants daily. Weber Road has served 1026 meals and averages an attendance of 53 participants daily. The number of meals served for all three branches combined is 5404 meals. We anticipate expanding this program to more branches for the summer of 2015.
		·         At the beginning of the school year, we will begin a new pilot service with five elementary schools in the Riverview Gardens School District and also with one elementary school in Jennings. Instead of issuing individual library cards to the children, the teachers will receive a classroom card.  Each child will be able to check out up to 3 books on the classroom card but will also have access to the books checked out by their classmates. This will ensure that all of the children will be able to check out materials even if they have exceeded the fines threshold on their individual card.
		·         The Library was contacted by Jennifer Blome at the Animal Protection Association of Missouri about partnerships.  In the fall, the Library will begin offering three different programs for children in conjunction with the APA.  The programs are entitled Kind Kids, Animal Safety and Litter Patrol.  The APA will bring dogs to two of these programs.  We hope to expand this partnership in the future.
		·         The Sweet Reads van began making visits on June 9th to various locations in Spanish Lake.  We have expanded the service this year from 4 to 13 locations.  To date, employees have assisted 1011 patrons and have distributed 5812 items.  We are very pleased with this program.  A copy of an article on the program was shared with Board members.
		·         Library employees met with representatives from the Society for the Blind about a partnership opportunity.  The Library will collect donations of used e-readers, which would be distributed to low vision, low income individuals.  The Society would heavily promote the e-resources at SLCL and direct people to the library to access content for their e-readers.  E-readers allow one to easily increase the text size making them ideal for the Society's clients.  We look to kick-off the partnership in August or September.
		·         Ms. Sorth said that Library employees will be trained on Go Noodle!, a software program underwritten by Mercy Hospitals making it free to users in the St. Louis region.  Go Noodle! is an online program used by many schools that includes short physical activities to promote activity and physical health.  The Library plans to use the program for children’s programming particularly at the free lunch programs and also during the after school program at Rock Road.
		·         We have contacted the St. Louis Mosaic Project regarding a potential partnership.  The Project was launched in 2012 in response to an economic impact report that showed St. Louis to be lagging in immigrant growth.  The report also highlighted the economic benefits of increasing the foreign-born population.  The Mosaic Project is a regional initiative that is professionally managed by St. Louis Economic Development Partnership, World Trade Center St. Louis and a 22-member committee whose goal is to transform St. Louis into the fastest growing metropolitan area for immigration by 2020 and promote regional prosperity through immigration and innovation.  We will be meeting to discuss hosting trained speakers at our branches that would educate local residents about immigration in our region.
		·         Natural Bridge Branch Manager, Parkie Peck, was quoted in an article about the new Epworth Center in Normandy.  A copy of the article was shared with the Board.
		·         The Sachs Reading Garden Committee reviewed the preliminary designs presented by SWT on June 24th.  SWT did a great job incorporating the desires of the donors, the Library and the Foundation.  In August, the Library Board will review the designs and the name of the garden.
		·         The community gardens at Prairie Commons and Cliff Cave are thriving this summer.  Both adult and children’s programs are held in the gardens.  Pictures of the gardens were shown to the Board.
		·         This summer we have hosted a number of great programs at our branches and at HQ.  Pictures of a variety of events were shown to the Board. They include Outdoor Art, Paws for Reading, Chinese Dance, Explore Science, DIY Circuits, Dr. Gigglewat, Bubble Mania, Dino O’Dell, Battle of the Bands, Eggceptional Experiments and Tye Dye Your Own T-shirt.  We also have pictures of children with their Summer Reading Club prizes.
		Library Employee Update
		·         The St. Louis County Library was named a Top Workplace for 2014 by the St. Louis Post Dispatch.  The announcement appeared in the Sunday, June 29th addition of the paper.  A copy of the article was shared with the Board.  The Library was ranked 13 out of 20 "Large" companies.  We were thrilled to receive this honor.
		·         The strategic planning process is going well.  Based on the patron and employee survey results, we have identified three areas of focus for the Strategic Plan: Literacy for all Residents, Improved Social Connectedness and a Strengthened Sense of Community and Neighborhood.  Employee committees have been formed to work on the three areas.  Marie Conlin is working closely with the committees.  The Library Board will review the Strategic Plan at the October Board Meeting.
		·         All Library employees will receive training on Preventing Harassment in the Workplace.  Attorneys from McMahon Berger will conduct this training.  Managers will receive management training related to harassment in the workplace on July 24.  Managers will also receive Performance Management training this September.
		·         The American Library Association’s Black Caucus will hold their meeting in St. Louis next August.  We plan to participate in this event.
		·         Branch Managers and Assistant Managers will participate in a Manager Swap this fall where they will be assigned to different branches for several days.  This has been a very successful program for us.  We plan to expand this program to include Library employees in 2015.
		Library Facility Update
		·         One of the air conditioning compressors at Grand Glaize has stopped working.  The air conditioning unit at the branch is running fine at this time but we will be replacing the compressor in the next few weeks.
		·         Building Systems and the Outreach Department are reviewing the preliminary drawings for the new Sweet Reads bookmobile.  Currently, we are using a delivery van for this service.
		·         We are not pleased with the work performance of the company that was hired for parking lot sealing and striping at various branches.  Eric has expressed our concerns to them in writing.  We look forward to their response.
		·         We are exploring options with the Missouri Department of Transportation regarding a sidewalk near our Rock Road branch.
		·         Ms. Sorth announced that the Library has won the Best Children’s Book Events award from Go Magazine.  She also reported that the Chris Colfer event was a huge success.

		OLD BUSINESS
		None
		NEW BUSINESS
		Youth Services
		Nicole Clawson, Youth Services Manager and Sarah Wood, Assistant Manager gave a presentation on the operations of the Youth Services Department.  Youth Service’s 10 full-time employees are responsible for programming for ages 0-17 at the Headquarters location. They also offer materials and information to support branch services to children and teens and develop programs such as Summer Reading Club, Winter Reading Club, Art @ Your Library, Children’s Book Week and Black History Month. In 2013, Youth Services planned over 5,000 youth programs system wide with approximately 140,000 attendees. Summer Reading Club is the largest program that Youth Services coordinates with 123,234 babies, children and teens participating so far this year. The presentation featured photographs of a selection of Youth Service’s programs and events.
		Dr. Beckwith thanked Ms. Clawson and Ms. Wood for their enjoyable and informative presentation.
		Employee Health Insurance Contribution
		Ms. Sorth presented a report on employee contributions toward the cost of health insurance. This report was one of the Library Director’s Goals for 2014.
		Ms. Sorth stated that the Library currently pays 97.5% of the premium for employees’ health insurance and pays 0% of family coverage. Since July 1, 2003, employees have contributed $15/month towards their health insurance. Ms. Sorth also presented comparative data on other Missouri library system’s contributions towards employees’ health insurance and family coverage.
		Mid-Continent Public Library in suburban Kansas City, MO, pays 100% for employees who participate in a health screening as part of their Employee Wellness Program. Employees who do not participate pay $50/month towards their premium. Mid Continent pays 0% for family coverage.
		Springfield-Greene County Library, Springfield, MO, pays 100% for employees and 0% for family coverage
		Kansas City Public Library, Kansas City, MO, offers 3 plan options. Plan 1: Pays 94% for employees and 67% for family coverage; Plan 2: Pays 85% for employees and 67% for family coverage; Plan 3: Pays 81% for employees and 64% for family coverage. The level of benefits differs between the plans.
		St. Charles City-County Library in St. Charles, MO, pays 90% for employees and 25% for family coverage.
		St. Louis Public Library, St. Louis, MO, pays 82% for employees and 27% for family coverage.
		Ms. Sorth stated that there are benefits to having employees contribute towards their health insurance premium including contributing to the Library’s budget for employee health insurance. In addition, by contributing, employees may become more aware of health insurance costs. Ms. Sorth remarked that there are also negatives to increasing the employee contribution. It could create a financial hardship for employees. Additionally, the Library’s benefit package helps us attract and maintain excellent employees.
		The Library’s renewal costs for the past five years have increased by an average of 6.8%. This is below the national average of 10 - 12% increases in health care costs during that same timeframe. The Library is in the process of implementing a Wellness Program for employees, programs that have been shown to help control health care costs. Ms. Sorth recommended leaving the contribution at $15 a month for 2014 and, in 2015, differentiating employees’ health insurance contribution based on their participation in the Wellness Program. Employees who do not participate in the Wellness Program in 2015 would be required to contribute more to the health insurance plan than those that do participate. More details will be shared with the Library Board during the 2015 budget discussion.
		Dr. Beckwith reported that Mr. Steve Sachs would like to increase the participation to $30 for all employees. This information was recently shared in a letter to the entire Board and Dr. Beckwith requested that the information be documented in the minutes.
		Library Code of Conduct
		Barbara Brain recommended that the Board approve revisions to the Library Code of Conduct.
		Ms. Brain stated that the Code of Conduct provides a useful guideline for staff when
		dealing with inappropriate patron behavior. Several changes have been made to the Code to
		remove dated language and also to add a couple of points that were not addressed in the last
		revision of the policy that was approved by the Board in April 2010.
		Specific examples of the changes include a statement about the need for “shirt and shoes” to be
		worn in the library and the addition of “electronic cigarettes” to the statement on smoking as well
		as a reference to the restriction on smoking within 25’ of building entrances. More minor
		changes include the removal of the reference to “pagers” from the section on cell phone use.
		Legal counsel has reviewed the draft policy.
		Dr. Beckwith asked for clarification on the term “expel” used in the Code.   He said that, in his view, the term referred to physical action.  Ms. Brain said that was not the intention and agreed to remove the word from the policy.
		The Library Board approved the revised Library Code of Conduct contingent upon the replacement of the word “expel” (Cunnane/Kenyon).
		Physical Way Finding Solutions
		Jennifer McBride presented a recommendation to approve the selection of Christner, Inc. to provide physical way finding solution services to the Library District.
		The Library Administration requested the submission of qualifications from consultants to
		provide Physical Way Finding Solutions in order to implement a cohesive, interior way-finding
		package at new SLCL facilities and existing branches.
		The RFQ was distributed on April 7, 2014 with responses due May 5, 2014. Six consultants responded. Kristen Sorth, Jennifer McBride, Eric Button and Emily Altoff independently reviewed and ranked the proposals based on the responses given to the proposal requirements. Once ranked, fee envelopes were opened and the two top-ranked firms were selected for interviews. Christner Inc. offered the lowest and best bid of $48,600. Bond proceeds will be used for this project.
		The Library Board approved the selection of Christner Inc. to provide Way Finding Solutions at a cost of $48,600 (Kenyon/Tai).
		Security and Fire Alarm Panel Upgrades
		Eric Button presented a recommendation on security and fire alarm panel upgrades.
		Mr. Button explained that each St. Louis County Library location has electronic control panels for security and fire alarm systems. Many of these panels are older making them difficult to service and repair. Additionally, some of the control panels have been creating problems with false alarms and inaccurate reporting of issues. The new panel at each location will integrate security and fire alarms into one panel and offer “callable” functionality, which provides a very specific description of the location and source of the trouble or alarm. This will provide a significant upgrade in functionality for staff and emergency responders and lead to quicker response times.
		An Invitation for Bid was issued on June 20, 2014 for work to be performed at
		Headquarters, Bridgeton Trails, Cliff Cave, Daniel Boone, Florissant Valley, Grand
		Glaize, Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Mid-County, Oak Bend, Samuel C. Sachs, and
		Thornhill. Four responses were received and Hackett Security Inc. was selected as the lowest and best bid.
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to select Hackett Security Inc. to provide security and fire alarm panel upgrades at a cost of $127,550.56 (Tai/Kenyon).  Funds were budgeted for this project in the 2014 Building Repair budget.
		Resolution Approving the Execution and Delivery of Certain Supplemental Documents in Connection with the District’s Certificates of Participation
		Kristen Sorth presented a recommendation that the Board approve a resolution regarding revisions to documents related to the Library’s Certificates of Participation.
		Several documents related to the Certificates of Participation have been revised to include the six branches that have been added to Phase 1 of the Facilities Master Plan. Those branches include Cliff Cave, Oak Bend, Natural Bridge, Prairie Commons, Samuel C. Sachs and Weber Road. The revisions will allow the Library to use revenue from the Certificates of Participation to pay for these projects.
		 The four documents were drafted by the Library’s Bond Counsel, Gilmore & Bell and include:
		1. A Resolution approving the execution and delivery of certain supplemental documents in connection with the District’s Certificates of Participation
		2. Exhibit A - Second Supplemental Base Lease
		3. Exhibit B - Second Supplemental Lease Purchase Agreement
		4. Exhibit C - Second Supplemental Declaration of Trust
		The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for the Resolution approving the execution and delivery of certain supplemental documents (Exhibit A, B and C) in connection with the District’s Certificates of Participation (Kenyon/Cunnane).
		First Amendment to Facilities Master Plan Construction Management Services
		Ms. Sorth presented an amendment to the Facilities Master Plan Construction Management Services.
		Ms. Sorth explained that changes to Phase 1 of the Facilities Master Plan necessitate an amendment to the Construction Management Services Agreement between the Library and S.M. Wilson. The First Amendment to the Agreement as drafted by attorneys at Lashly & Baer was shown to Board members along with the revised schedule that was presented to the Library Board at the June Board Meeting.
		The Amendment outlines the branches now included in Phase 1 Construction and makes some minor changes to titles and contacts in the agreement. The Amendment also addresses additional compensation due to S.M. Wilson resulting from the revised or additional work related to the projects in Phase 1 of the Facilities Master Plan. Due to changes in the schedule, scope and the inclusion of six additional projects in Phase 1, S.M. Wilson is entitled to $781,914 in additional compensation for Construction Management Services. Their total compensation is a not-to-exceed amount of $2,684,249.
		The Library Board approved the First Amendment to the Facilities Master Plan Construction Management Services Agreement (Cunnane/Tai).
		ADJOURN
		The Library Board voted to adjourn the meeting at 4:26 p.m.
		All approved by voice vote.
		Aye: Lynn Beckwith, Dr. Chingling Tai, Edith Cunnane, and Elena G Kenyon
