		PUBLIC COMMENT
		There were no public comments.
		TREASURER’S REPORT
		Kristen Sorth reported that the Collector of Revenue’s office released the 2014 taxes
		paid under protest and the Library District received just over $4.6 million in revenue. The
		Library District has reached 100% of the budgeted current year tax revenue for 2015.
		In June, the Library District received $23,958 in revenue from the reciprocal agreements with the Municipal Libraries. This represents five of the eight libraries that were invoiced. Ms. Sorth stated that the remaining three library’s payments are expected in the next couple of months. Total revenue to be received after all libraries have made payment is approximately $84,000.
		The Library made its first payment of $21,380 to H&H Health Associates for the Wellness Program. This payment was for optional health screenings available to full time employees. The Library expects a second payment to be made soon for a similar amount. The costs were included in the 2015 budget.
		In June, the Library renewed its membership with the Mid America Library Alliance (MALA) at $4,609. MALA provides delivery service for interlibrary loan between St. Louis County Library and other area libraries. The Library District also renewed its membership with the Urban Libraries Council for $3,000.
		The Library spent just under $31,000 in new PC purchases in June. The new PC’s will go largely to replacing the public computers in the library’s reference area at Headquarters and at area branches that are not part of the Phase 1 construction.
		Capital Projects Fund Balance Sheet
		Total Construction in Progress for June 2015 was $1,279,001. The expenses included payments for:
		·         Grants View construction (payable to many sub-contractors) - $94,170
		·         Lewis and Clark construction (payable to many sub-contractors) – $716,608
		·         Professional services of the Construction Manager - $268,478
		·         Architect’s fees payable to Bond Architects, KAI, and Christner – $248,967
		·         The remaining dollars were largely spent for the services of the Facilities Master
		Plan Administrator, storage expenses, and environmental professional services.
		The Library Board approved the Treasurer’s Report subject to audit (Sachs/Cunnane).
		DIRECTOR'S REPORT
		Kristen Sorth gave the following report.
		Library Update
		·         Ms. Sorth said the dashboard report for July contains a variety of statistical information for the Library. The report was shared with the Board. This month the report includes information about circulation and visits.  It is important to note that even with five branches closed, circulation has only dropped 6% over June 2014.  This month, the report also includes information about outreach, computer classes, the free lunch program and summer reading club. The most popular items in the collection are also included.  As of mid July, 53,120 people have signed up for Summer Reading Club with 15,505 completions.
		·         The Boeing Employees Community Fund awarded the Library $5000 for the development of science kits that will be available for check out.  The Youth Services Department is currently developing the kits which will include a science activity, a book and a DVD related to the particular science topic of the kit.  Titles such as Forces, Energy and Motion, Simple Machines, Lego Chain Reactions and Magnets will be available at several branches including Daniel Boone, Florissant Valley, Grand Glaize, HQ, Indian Trails and Lewis and Clark.  Ms. Sorth stated that we are piloting the kits at these locations and will later expand them to additional locations. The science kit pertaining to magnets was shown to the Board.
		·         Ms. Sorth said that the History & Genealogy department will open its staff-only area to the public the third weekend of each month.  The staff-only area houses more than 13,000 family histories, school yearbooks, and information about many states west of the Mississippi. Researchers are encouraged to browse and use the materials during the “Explore Tier 4” weekends.  History & Genealogy staff will also offer tours on third Saturdays.  Usually, items from Tier 4 are available only upon request and are retrieved by a librarian for use in the library. “Explore Tier 4” weekends will allow researchers and genealogists to access this area and browse its holdings independently.
		·         The Daniel Boone Branch began offering a Homework Help program on alternating Mondays and Tuesdays for six weeks at the end of the 2015 school year.  Thirty-five students attended the program which offered strategies and techniques for effective test-taking as well as tips for homework success.  Two employees facilitated the program and also worked with each attendee on homework while offering advice and guidance if the child was struggling.  Lewis and Clark will offer a similar program when the new branch opens in the fall.
		·         Ms. Sorth said that, thanks to MOREnet, the Library now has access to the EBSCO eBook Public Library Collection. This collection includes more than 40,000 titles. The titles in this collection are searchable and include unlimited and simultaneous access to all of the titles.
		·         Library trainers are offering a new “bring your own device” class for iPads and iPhones.  Twenty-three people attended the first class at HQ in a room that has 12 seats.  Patrons were so thrilled to attend the class that some even opted to sit on the floor.  A picture was shown of the training room in HQ filled with those attending the class.
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that the Library has experienced DVD, CD and video game theft at several branches during the past two weeks.  Administration suspected it was the same individual going to multiple Library locations and we have now confirmed our suspicions by reviewing video footage as well as catching the individual in the act.  Quick thinking Library employees were able to write down the car license plate number of the individual.  The matter has been turned over to the police and is under investigation.
		·         The St. Louis Rams have selected the Library’s Free Lunch program at Florissant Valley and Natural Bridge as the location for their Employee Day of Service.  Volunteers from the Rams will be at both locations on July 24th.  Prior to arriving, the volunteers will purchase and assemble dinner kits and will bring them to Florissant Valley and Natural Bridge.  Each child attending the free lunch program will also take home a dinner kit for their family. The volunteers will also bring paper bags and craft supplies so the kids can decorate their own bag for the meal kit.  Suggestions for items to be included in the meal kits were provided by Operation Food Search (OFS).  The Free Lunch program is going well but Ms. Sorth said that we have concerns regarding the caterer that was selected by OFS.  We have not been pleased by their service and are communicating that to OFS.
		·         Ms. Sorth said she recently received a letter from the Valley Park Community Library Board of Trustees.  The Board has voted to withdraw from the reciprocal borrowing agreement with St. Louis County Library effective September 1, 2015.  Plans are underway to inform the public about this change.  Bookmarks will be created, staff will be trained and information will be available on our website.  Valley Park residents with a current SLCL card can use their card through December 31, 2015. After that time, Valley Park residents will be required to purchase a $50 non-resident card to borrow materials from St. Louis County Library. Individuals who live in Valley Park and wish to apply for a new SLCL card after July 1, 2015 will need to purchase a $50 non-resident card to borrow materials.  Children enrolled in any school in St. Louis County are still eligible for a free St. Louis County Library card. A library card is not required to attend programs, classes or to use public computers at St. Louis County Library.
		·         The Urban Libraries Council has chosen St. Louis County Library as its 2015 Top Innovator in the Health, Wellness and Public Safety category for the Library’s Summer Free Lunch Program.  The ULC is a membership association of leading public library systems in the United States and Canada. Each year the ULC honors the best practices and innovations in a variety of categories such as education, lifelong learning, workforce and economic development, public safety, health and wellness and environmental sustainability.   The awards were given at the ULC Annual Forum which was held in San Jose, California from June 24-June 26.  Ms. Sorth said that she and Gib Van Cleve attended the conference and accepted the award on behalf of the Library at an evening awards celebration.
		·         Ms Sorth was invited to a meeting with the publisher of The St. Louis American, Dr. Donald Suggs and the editorial director, Chris King to discuss the Library.  She met with both of them on Friday, July 17, 2015.
		·         Harper Lee's novel, “Go Set a Watchman” has garnered a tremendous amount of publicity over the past few months. The library had almost 950 holds on the title before it was made available for checkout on July 14, the publisher's street date. Additional copies of To Kill a Mockingbird have also been purchased.
		·         There were additional mentions of the St. Louis County Library in the local media as well as national media.  The national media includes The Huffington Post and Library Journal.  Those articles were shared with the Board.
		·         Ms. Sorth showed a number of photos to the Board from several programs and events including: Nitro Joe – Meramec Valley, Superhero Selfies – Prairie Commons, Mario Party – Natural Bridge, Brad Meltzer and Fred Bird – HQ, STArt, Wiggly World of Worms – Oak Bend and Babaloo – Cliff Cave.
		Library Employee Update
		·         Ms. Sorth said she was pleased to announce that The St. Louis County Library was named a Top Workplace for 2015 by the St. Louis Post Dispatch.  The announcement appeared in the Sunday, June 29th edition of the paper and was shared with the Board.  The Library was ranked 5 out of 20 "Large" companies.  Staff was thrilled to receive this honor. The designation was made after library staff was surveyed by an independent research organization. Library employees responded to questions about job satisfaction, benefits, management, training opportunities and leadership. 87% of Library employees responded to the survey.
		·         As part of the wellness program, H&H Health Associates is offering information meetings to full-time employees who participated in the wellness screenings. A nurse will be conducting a presentation to give a general overview of the testing that was provided in the screenings.
		·         Larry Franke from the History and Genealogy Department received the 2015 Certificate of Appreciation from the Missouri State Genealogical Association.
		·         The Library received five applications for the Donnell J. Gaertner Scholarship.  The $5000 scholarship toward a Master’s Degree in Library Science was developed several years ago with funds donated by previous St. Louis County Library Director, Don Gaertner.  There is a process for review and selection and a recipient will be determined in the next several weeks.
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that Library employees were saddened to learn that Finance employee Alison Schnettgoecke died unexpectedly on June 21st.  Alison was involved each month in the preparation of the Treasurer’s Report for the Library Board Meetings and also worked closely with the Treasurer of the Foundation Board.
		Library Facility Update
		·         Ms. Sorth reported that planning for Phase 2 of the construction projects continues.  An RFQ for Phase 2 architects and an RFP for a Phase 2 construction manager were posted today.  The Library Board will review the recommendations for these at the September Library Board meeting.
		·         Ms. Sorth and Steve Hunter will be meeting with Colliers to tour potential locations for a new Meramec Valley Branch.
		·         Ms. Sorth said that this has been a challenging month for branch HVAC systems.  Tesson Ferry, HQ and Florissant Valley have all experienced problems with the HVAC during the extremely hot weather.
		Library Foundation
		·         Work at the Sachs Reading Garden is progressing but was hampered by the very rainy June weather.  The Foundation is actively fundraising for a shade structure to be installed in the garden.
		·         There are several corporate grant opportunities related to enhancements at renovated or new branches. Ms. Sorth and Jim Bogart have been meeting with potential donors.

		OLD BUSINESS
		NONE
		NEW BUSINESS
		CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
		Steve Hunter reported on the branch renovations and new construction and shared photographs of the projects with the Library Board.
		He stated that Jamestown Bluffs will be the first renovation project to be completed and that it is expected to be turned back to the Library in late August. At that point, work will begin to install shelving, equipment, furniture and collections in preparation for the branch re-opening to the public. Work packages for the rest of the Phase 1 projects will be presented to the Board in September.
		Mr. Hunter also reported that Requests for Qualifications will soon go out for the Phase 2 projects that will include Daniel Boone, Grand Glaize, Florissant Valley, Bridgeton Trails, Meramec Valley, Thornhill, Mid County and the Operations Center.
		Dr. Beckwith thanked Mr. Hunter for his presentation.
		CONTINGENCY FOR LEWIS & CLARK
		Steve Hunter presented a recommendation to transfer funds from the Phase 1 Program contingency to the Lewis & Clark project-specific contingency.
		Mr. Hunter reported that the original contingency will not be sufficient to complete the Lewis & Clark project, due primarily to additional abatement requirements during the demolition and the need to address unsuitable soils under the old building. He stated that a transfer of $150,000 from the overall Phase I contingency to the Lewis & Clark project-specific contingency will more accurately match cost projections. These funds have previously been authorized as part of the original $58M Phase I Certificates of Participation.
		The Library Board approved Administration’s recommendation to transfer $150,000 from the Phase 1 Program contingency to the Lewis & Clark project-specific contingency. (Kenyon/Cunnane).
		CODE OF ETHICS
		Kristen Sorth presented legal counsel’s recommendation for approval of the revised Code of Ethics. A copy of the Code of Ethics with changes noted was shared with the Board.
		Ms. Sorth explained that State Statute requires that the Board approve a Code of Ethics every two years. The approved policy must be sent to the Missouri Ethics Commission by September 1st.
		Legal counsel recommended removing the language relating to transactions in excess of $1500 during the calendar year since this language is not in the current provision of the statute.
		Mr. Sachs was in favor of keeping the $1500 in the language.  Discussion ensued.
		The Library Board approved the revised resolution (Cunnane/Tai).
		Aye: Lynn Beckwith, Dr. Chingling Tai, Edith Cunnane, Elena G Kenyon
		Nay: Steve Sachs
		COMPUTER USE POLICY
		Barbara Brain presented the Administration’s recommendation for approval of a revised Computer Use policy.
		Ms. Brain said that the policy was last reviewed and approved by the Library Board on May 18, 2009 and several revisions have been made to the policy with input from legal counsel. An introductory paragraph has been added that outlines the purposes for which the library’s public computers may be used. It makes the point that individual users must take responsibility for their use of the Internet and for monitoring use by their minor children. It also makes clear that all computers are filtered in accordance with federal and state law.
		Many of the changes are simply a reorganization of existing information but a few specific points have been added including a statement that “personal computing devices may only connect via the wireless network” and “the library does not provide a bypass for web filtering on its wireless network”. The final section dealing with eligibility to use public computers by adults, children and teens has been condensed. The revised policy statement with changes tracked was shared with the Board.
		The Library Board approved the revised Computer Use Policy. (Cunnane/Kenyon).
		ADJOURN
		A motion was made by Edith Cunnane and seconded by Elena G. Kenyon to adjourn.
		All members approved with voice vote.  The meeting adjourned at 4:25 p.m.
		Respectfully submitted by:                                                     Date:
