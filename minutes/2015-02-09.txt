	·         The remaining dollars were largely spent for the services of the Facilities Master Plan Administrator, storage unit rental, and legal fees.
	The Library Board approved the Treasurer’s Report subject to audit (Cunnane/Tai).
	DIRECTOR'S REPORT
	Kristen Sorth reported the following information.
	Library Update
	·         Ms. Sorth said that the “dashboard” report for January/February contains a variety of statistical information for the Library. This month the report includes year-end statistics for 2013 and 2014 comparing numbers for programming, meeting room usage, computer usage and volunteers.  The report also contains information about the Library’s December 2014 statistics.  The Library had the highest December circulation on record.  Program attendance also saw a significant increase at 40.2% in December.   Other interesting statistics include the number of new patrons and the number of items added to the Library’s collection in 2014.  The most popular items in the collection are also included.
	·         During the first round of renovations, the Library will send a community bookmobile to the parking lot of Shop ‘n Save at the St. Johns store on St. Charles Rock Road.   We want to provide library service to the communities around the Rock Road Branch and the Indian Trails Branch since they will be closed at the same time.  We may consider using a community bookmobile for other closures during construction.
	·         The Youth Services Department is holding a two-part workshop for families with children eligible to enter kindergarten in fall 2015. One was held in January and the other will take place this month at the Florissant Valley Branch.  Library staff will provide a checklist for parents to know what signs indicate kindergarten readiness and provide tips on how to strengthen the required skills. The workshop’s goal is to help the participants, both parents and children, have a successful transition to kindergarten.
	·         In June 2014, the Library Board approved a change to the reciprocal borrowing agreement between the St. Louis County Library and the Municipal Library Consortium.  This change will eliminate the transaction fee on renewed items.  All of the consortium libraries have approved the change, which began on January 1, 2015.
	·         The next six-week-long Earn-A-Computer program presented by the Library and BWorks began this month at the Florissant Valley and Oak Bend branches. Courses will again cover topics such as Internet safety, computer programming, and creating and delivering presentations on the PC.  Students that attend all six sessions and meet the participation requirements will receive a complete PC system.
	·         Ms. Sorth said that the Library hosted 22 Red Cross blood drives for the staff and the public from September through December.  481 units of blood were collected.  A thank you letter from the Red Cross was distributed.  There is a meeting scheduled to discuss plans for 2015.
	·         The Acquisitions and Cataloging Departments work very hard to make sure that the branches have plenty of new materials on the shelf for patrons to check out. The Library cataloged 44,926 titles in 2014, more than in any previous year. 16,690 of those titles were ebooks and that is double the number of ebook titles added in 2013.
	·         The Library receives many purchase requests for TV shows on DVD and, up to now, our practice has been to add only those shows that are no longer on the air. Recently, staff has developed a plan to purchase Emmy nominated Outstanding Drama and Outstanding Comedy series.  Adding a limited number of current TV shows will be very popular with our patrons and will be manageable within the collection development budget.
	·         The Library is now a member of the Mid-States Minority Supplier Development Council.  Steve Hunter and Ms. Sorth met with their director recently.  Ms. Sorth said that she believes they can assist the Library with its minority goals for construction.  Their primary mission is to promote and cultivate successful minority enterprises within the Central Illinois, Indiana and Eastern Missouri business communities. They serve as an advocate for the economic well-being and growth of certified MBEs, while also providing a direct connection for organizations that are committed to purchasing products and services from certified MBEs.
	·         Plans for the Sachs Reading Garden are progressing.   Lashly Baer is currently reviewing the construction bid documents.  SWT and the Library are working with the City of Chesterfield on various permits required prior to construction.
	·         Ms. Sorth reported that she will be traveling to Jefferson City for Library Advocacy Day on Tuesday, February 10 along with 12 other managers and assistant managers to meet with the legislators that represent our library district. A big topic will be the Governor’s budget which reduces state aid for public libraries and eliminates funding for MOREnet.
	·         Ms. Sorth has mentioned in several previous reports that the Library planned to offer several programs related to Alzheimer’s.  The library, in partnership with Maturity and Its Muse and the Alzheimer's Association, is planning a special event called "Exploring Still Alice," featuring an on-stage discussion about Alzheimer's Disease with researchers from Washington University and a person with early onset of the disease.  The discussion, which will be moderated by Guy Phillips of Y98, will utilize the story from the Lisa Genova novel and recent film Still Alice.  The event, which is tentatively scheduled for April 21, 2015, will serve as a kick-off to book discussions on Still Alice that are taking place at six library locations in the weeks following.  Final details are still in development.
	·         The Library has many events planned by the Library's Black History Celebration Committee co-chaired by Sandy Williams.  We anticipate that two of the events in particular will be very well attended by the public.  Award-winning broadcaster and bestselling author, Tavis Smiley, will discuss his new book, "Death of a King," on Saturday, February 7th at HQ at 7:00 p.m.  On Saturday, February 28 at 7:00 p.m., the Gift of Gospel Celebration will take place at the Florissant Valley Branch.  This will include several gospel artists featuring the Voices of Glory (made popular by “America’s Got Talent.”)
	·         Ms. Sorth said that she mentioned in a previous report that she was introduced to Dr. Jason Purnell at Washington University by Yemi Akande-Bartsch, Executive Director of Focus St. Louis.  Jason was responsible for a joint venture between Wash U and SLU entitled "For The Sake of All:  A report on the health and well-being of African Americans in St. Louis and why it matters for everyone."  Jason and his team are partnering with Focus St. Louis, Wash U and St. Louis Public Radio on the recommendation and implementation phase of this report.  Part of that involves community forums on the six areas of focus. The next community forum will be held in March and is focused on childhood development and literacy.  The Library will be participating in that forum as well as a resource fair connected with the forum.  We are also discussing some additional ways that the Library can be involved including having a link to the report on our reference department webpage and having reference copies of the report available at all of the branches for patrons to use.
	·         There were additional mentions of the St. Louis County Library in the media. Those articles were distributed.
	·         Ms. Sorth had a number of photos to show the Board from several programs and events including the Holiday Open House at Rock Road, Small Business Expo at HQ, Tree Trimming Party at Natural Bridge, Space Frontiers at Sachs and Author, Ishmael Beah, at HQ.
	Library Employee Update
	·         Ms. Sorth mentioned that the Library Staff Association’s annual holiday food drive to benefit Operation Food Search began on November 4 and continued until December 31, 2014.  Both staff and patrons participated in this food drive.  5984 pounds of food were collected this year.
	·         Employee meetings were held for Library employees to learn about the 457/Deferred Compensation benefit.
	·         12 staff members have been selected to serve on the Library's new Green Team to identify and implement specific environmentally friendly solutions for the Library and to help educate and inspire co-workers about sustainability. Jean Ponzi, Green Resources Manager of the Earthways Center, joined the first meeting. A letter was received from the St. Louis Regional Chamber congratulating the Library on successfully earning the Award of Achievement – Apprentice Level in the 2014 St. Louis Green Business Challenge. Barbara Brain attended the awards luncheon on January 20th.  Ms. Sorth shared a copy of the letter from St. Louis Regional Chamber with the Library Board.
	Library Facility Update
	·         Ms. Sorth stated that upgrades to the Library’s fire and burglar alarm panels are almost complete at Headquarters, Bridgeton Trails, Cliff Cave, Daniel Boone, Florissant Valley, Grand Glaize, Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Mid-County, Oak Bend, Samuel C. Sachs and Thornhill.
	·         The HVAC unit at HQ responsible for heating Building Systems and Outreach was not working because the unit had a cracked heat exchanger.  Because there was a concern for carbon monoxide poisoning, the unit was turned off while the part was on order.  Those departments had several chilly days.  The unit has been repaired.
	·         Beginning in February, one additional off duty St. Louis County Police officer will be reporting to the Lewis and Clark Branch.  There will now be two officers at the branch from 4:30 – 7:30 p.m. Monday – Thursday.  There have been several recent incidents at the branch necessitating this change.
	·         Ms. Sorth reported that the renovation construction schedule will begin next week as follows:

	OLD BUSINESS
	NONE
	NEW BUSINESS
	Investment of 2015 Operating Funds
	Kris Mooney reported on the results from St. Louis County Library’s Request for Investment Rates mailed January 29, 2015 and received February 6, 2015. The request was sent to eleven St. Louis area banks and one Kansas City area bank.  Six banks returned rate quotes for investments of the $36 million of 2015 operating funds. These results were attached for the Library Board to review.
	The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation for the selection of First Bank which returned the highest total rate of return for the entire portfolio (Sachs/Kenyon).
	Construction Update
	Steve Hunter reported on progress on the Grant’s View and Lewis & Clark construction projects. The steel structure has been erected and concrete poured at Grant’s View.
	Mr. Hunter said that the Lewis and Clark construction is currently tracking ahead of Grant’s View and the decision to close the existing branch on April 4 will allow the project to be completed by August instead of January.
	Two community forums were held at Lewis & Clark to discuss reasons for the decision to change the closure date for the existing building. Both meetings were well attended and good questions were posed by those present.
	Mr. Hunter stated that the Indian Trails Branch was scheduled to close on Saturday February 14 and Jamestown Bluffs will follow a week later. Dr. Beckwith requested an update on the number of minority workers involved in the projects as a percentage of the total workforce.
	Food for Fines
	Barbara Brain reported on the “Food for Fines” option that the Library has offered for the past sixteen years during National Library Week.
	National Library Week will be celebrated April 12-18 this year and, during that time, the administration recommended that customers be allowed to pay outstanding fines with canned
	goods. The food would then be given to Operation Food Search for distribution to local food pantries.
	“Food for Fines” has generated positive publicity for the Library and it also encourages the
	return of overdue items. Last year, the Library collected over 32,000 pounds of food during the week. Patrons have been able to exchange one can of food for $1 in fines up to a maximum of $10.
	The Library Board approved the recommendation that the “Food for Fines” option be offered again this year with a $10 maximum per account. (Sachs/Tai).
	Library Board Policy I and Policy II
	Kristen Sorth reported that she met with Lisa Stump from Lashly & Baer to discuss the Library Board’s procedures for purchases of goods and services and for professional services. Policy I which includes procurement procedures other than professional services was last updated in August 2012. Policy II includes professional services and was last updated in September 2009. Ms. Sorth and Ms. Stump felt that it was time to update the procedures to reflect current law and practices. She shared the edited versions and final versions of Policy I and Policy II with Board members.
	The Library Board approved Policy I and Policy II as revised by the Library Board’s attorney, Lashly & Baer (Cunnane/Tai).

	Diversity Goals – Branch Renovations at Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Rock Road and Weber Road
	Kristen Sorth presented information on progress towards the diversity goals for the branch renovation projects. Ms. Sorth explained that, later in the meeting, the Library Board would review 15 work packages for renovations at Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Rock Road and Weber Road. The bid process involved a review by the Library, Landmark, S.M. Wilson and Sandra Marks, S.M. Wilson’s Diversity Consultant, as to whether the packages meet the diversity goals of 15% for minority owned businesses and 5% for women owned businesses outlined in the Library’s Diversity Statement. Good faith efforts went beyond those required in the Library’s policy and included advertisements, notifications, conversations, meetings and outreach that began in early January and continued to the day of the public bid opening. Ms. Sorth shared a letter from S.M. Wilson describing these efforts in more detail.
	The work packages were released on January 13, 2015 with responses due on January 29, 2015. Minority goals were included in those documents. Board members were provided with a summary of the responses received as well as the minority percentages indicated for each low bidder. All bidders were required to submit a Good Faith Effort Statement detailing their attempts to include diversity in their bid proposals. Ms. Sorth also provided the Board with an analysis of the bids detailing the total construction amount for each work package as well as the percent and the amount of construction dollars paid to a minority or woman owned business for each work package.
	The total percent of construction awarded to minority owned businesses is 10.2% and the total amount for women owned businesses is 1.48%. Ms. Sorth stated that the Administration is disappointed by the percentages but found that a significant Good Faith Effort was made by all involved to encourage minority participation on these projects. She went on to say that contributing factors to the percentage of minority participation include the construction environment in the region with several very large projects that have their own diversity requirements combined with a limited number of minority owned businesses in certain construction areas.
	Ms. Sorth emphasized that she, Dr. Beckwith and Steve Hunter have attended several meetings to discuss the diversity goals. The Library, Landmark and S.M. Wilson will continue to emphasize the Library’s Diversity Statement and will monitor and encourage minority workforce participation which goes above and beyond the goals of the Library’s policy on this and all future projects.
	Contracts and Contingency for Construction of Four 1B Branch Renovations
	Steve Hunter presented the Administration’s recommendation to approve the lowest and best bid on 15 work packages for the first four renovation projects in Phase 1B (Indian Trails, Jamestown Bluffs, Weber Road, and Rock Road). Final construction documents were delivered by Bond Architects on January 9, 2015. The work was organized into separate work packages, which were released for bid on January 13, 2015.

Pre-bid / Outreach meetings were held in each of the four branches on January 21 & 22. Bids were due January 29, 2015 and opened in a public meeting at Weber Road Branch. 47 bids and multiple responses were received in 14 of the 15 work packages.

	Email Marketing Services
	Jennifer McBride presented the Administration’s request for approval of Market Volt to provide Email Marketing Services to include sending a high volume of electronic communications to library patrons, as well as tracking and organizing these communications.
	An Invitation for Bid (IFB) was distributed on October 27, 2014 and posted on the Library’s website with responses due December 1, 2014. Two vendors responded and the bids were opened at a public opening on December 29, 2014. Market Volt was selected as the best qualified firm with the lowest reasonable fee.
	The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to select Market Volt to provide Email Marketing Services to the Library District at an annual cost of $15,600 in accordance with the Library District’s Policy II for Professional Services. (Sachs/Tai).
	Video Production Services
	Jennifer McBride presented the Administration’s request for approval of Falk Harrison to produce two short videos to promote summer reading club during school visits by Library District staff.
	One video will target children in grades kindergarten-5th grade. The other video will target teens in grades 6-12. The goal of each video is to spread awareness and increase participation in the summer reading club.
	A Request for Proposal (RFP) was distributed on January 26, 2015 with responses due February 4, 2015. It was posted on the Library’s website. Four responses were received and the bids were opened at a public opening on February 4, 2015. Falk Harrison was determined to be the best-qualified firm with the lowest reasonable fee. Ms. McBride added that the Library had received a Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grant from the Missouri State Library in the amount of $12,500 to fund this project.
	The Library Board approved the Administration’s recommendation to select Falk Harrison to provide Video Production Services to the Library District at a cost of $10,000 in accordance with the Library District’s Policy II for Professional Services. (Kenyon/Tai).
	Shared Services Agreement
	Kristen Sorth requested Board approval of a revised Shared Services Agreement between the Library and the Foundation. Ms. Sorth explained that the Shared Services Agreement defines the level of support provided by the Library to the Foundation and is a requirement of the Affiliation Agreement between the Library and the Foundation.
	Ms. Sorth stated that the Foundation Board’s Executive Committee had reviewed the agreement at length and their recommendations were incorporated into the document to more accurately reflect the level of support provided for the Foundation by the Library. In addition, the Foundation Board agrees to reimburse the Library for up to 100% of the salaries for the Manager, Development and the Friends Coordinator who utilize 100% of their time in performing services for the Foundation. The agreement was revised to reflect the level of support as determined and voted on by the Foundation’s Executive Committee. The document indicating all revisions and also the final version were shared with the Board.
	The Library Board approved the revised annual Shared Services Agreement as recommended by the Administration and the Library Foundation Board’s Executive Committee. This agreement supersedes and thereby terminates the Shared Services Agreement dated June 10, 2014. The term of this new agreement will terminate on December 31, 2015. (Cunnane/Kenyon).
